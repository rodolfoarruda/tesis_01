abstract={Context: Security bug report (SBR) identification is a crucial way to eliminate security-critical vulnerabilities during software development. Objective: In recent years, many approaches have utilized supervised machine learning (SML) techniques in the SBR identification. However, such approaches often require a large number of labelled bug reports, which are often hard to obtain in practice. Active learning is a potential approach to reducing the manual labelling cost while maintaining good performance. Nevertheless, the existing active learning-based SBR identification approach still yields poor performance due to ignoring the locality in bug reports. Method: To address the above problems, we propose locality-based SBR identification via active learning. Our approach recommends a small part of instances based on locality in bug reports, asks for their labels, and learns the SBR classifier. Specifically, our approach relies on the locality to construct the initial training set, which is designed to address how to start during active learning. Moreover, our approach applies the locality into the query process, which is designed to improve which instance should be queried next during active learning. Result: We conduct experiments on large-scale bug reports (nearly 125K) from six real-world projects. In comparison with three state-of-the-art SML-based and active learning-based SBR identification approaches, our approach can obtain the maximum values of F-Measure (0.8176) and AUC (0.8631). Moreover, our approach requires 16.60% to 71.40% of all bug reports when achieving the optimal performance in these six projects, which improves three approaches from 9.82% to 64.19% on average. Conclusion: As shown from the experimental results, our approach can be more effective and efficient to identify SBRs than the existing approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of technology in teaching economics has become increasingly popular in recent decades, and the rapid evolution of the sector has the potential to revolutionize education. Yet, despite the wide range of methods implemented in economics courses, more research is required regarding examples of how active-learning methodologies can be combined with technology to foster student learning, raise awareness regarding real-world complexities, and enhance the acquisition of multiple learning outcomes. This study presents an online role-play simulation designed to help students understand the intricacies of International Political Economy, while fostering essential cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning outcomes. Students participated in teams representing different countries seeking to improve their economic status by producing products and exchanging them with other countries, all while monitoring their performance in five core structures of International Political Economy: global production, global trade, global finance, global knowledge, and global security. These structures and all the economic interactions were managed using a single spreadsheet. The study uses pre- and post-simulation quantitative and qualitative information to assess the students’ perception about the methodology. The implementation of this problem-based, online, collaborative learning activity demonstrated that the students perceived the experience as a useful teaching and learning strategy. © 2022},

abstract={When severe disturbance occurs in power system, lack of efficacious information about transient stability state is a key challenge for power network operator. Especially for the system operating in boundary of security constraints due to economic reasons, it becomes more prominent. With the extensive deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), abundant historical data of power system have been collected and the data driven method based on machine learning model has become important tool to solve transient stability assessment (TSA) problem. However, the implementation of data-driven TSA method is difficult due to the characteristics of huge feature number and variable network topology of large-scale modern power system. In order to address this issue, a novel deep learning-based online TSA framework is proposed in this article. Firstly, parallel convolution algorithms are employed to address redundant input features. secondly, a novel machine learning model, deep forest is employed to train a TSA model. Some improvements are implemented for better assessment performance: 1) The internal feature transmission of deep forest is adjusted for higher assessment accuracy. 2) A fast update scheme is proposed based on active learning technique and graded strategy. 3) The cost-based method is employed to address class-imbalance training data. The test results on three power systems show that the proposed TSA framework has advantages in prediction accuracy, training speed, and update time. It is suitable for application of large-scale modern power system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Context: Security teams are overwhelmed by thousands of alerts and events everyday, which are comprehensively collected for threat analysis in security operations center. Although methods based on rules, intelligence and data mining are utilized, the alert fatigue situation is still a challenging problem, slowing down the overall threat investigation process. Objective: ‘Event polysemy’ phenomenon broadly exists in large-scale event dataset, which means that events of the same category can reveal different purposes in different contexts. This paper aims at exploring, revealing and evaluating the latent patterns embedding in the event contexts, to gain insight on context semantics and reduce manual intervention in event triage tasks. Method: A context representation learning based method, named Context2Vector, is proposed. Contexts are extracted from multiple behavioral views. Then, both dense event representations and sparse topic representations are learnt at the same time and in the same space. A human-in-the-loop topic annotation process is involved and finally, a context deviation detection based method is integrated to generate explainable and informative labels for automated context semantic decoding. Results: Various experiments are conducted on a enterprise-scale event dataset. The topic annotation, context related feature importance and top-N event ranking evaluation results show that Context2Vector outperforms traditional methods on the high-risk event identification problems, improving the attacker recall rate by up to 2.25 times within limited events to be investigated. Conclusion: It is concluded that event contexts imply practicable and abundant information in regard to behaviors and intents of real threat actors. More precise profiling of network entities can be extracted from contexts, compared to rules, intelligence, and anomaly detectors used in practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Network Traffic Classification (NTC) has become an important feature in various network management operations, e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning and security services. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as a popular approach for NTC can promise reasonable accuracy in classification and deal with encrypted traffic. However, ML-based NTC techniques suffer from the shortage of labeled traffic data which is the case in many real-world applications. This study investigates the applicability of an active form of ML, called Active Learning (AL), in NTC. AL reduces the need for a large number of labeled examples by actively choosing the instances that should be labeled. The study first provides an overview of NTC and its fundamental challenges along with surveying the literature on ML-based NTC methods. Then, it introduces the concepts of AL, discusses it in the context of NTC, and review the literature in this field. Further, challenges and open issues in AL-based classification of network traffic are discussed. Moreover, as a technical survey, some experiments are conducted to show the broad applicability of AL in NTC. The simulation results show that AL can achieve high accuracy with a small amount of data. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Mapping the characteristics of Africa’s smallholder-dominated croplands, including the sizes and numbers of fields, can provide critical insights into food security and a range of other socioeconomic and environmental concerns. However, accurately mapping these systems is difficult because there is 1) a spatial and temporal mismatch between satellite sensors and smallholder fields, and 2) a lack of high-quality labels needed to train and assess machine learning classifiers. We developed an approach designed to address these two problems, and used it to map Ghana’s croplands. To overcome the spatio-temporal mismatch, we converted daily, high resolution imagery into two cloud-free composites (the primary growing season and subsequent dry season) covering the 2018 agricultural year, providing a seasonal contrast that helps to improve classification accuracy. To address the problem of label availability, we created a platform that rigorously assesses and minimizes label error, and used it to iteratively train a Random Forests classifier with active learning, which identifies the most informative training sample based on prediction uncertainty. Minimizing label errors improved model F1 scores by up to 25%. Active learning increased F1 scores by an average of 9.1% between first and last training iterations, and 2.3% more than models trained with randomly selected labels. We used the resulting 3.7 m map of cropland probabilities within a segmentation algorithm to delineate crop field boundaries. Using an independent map reference sample (n = 1,207), we found that the cropland probability and field boundary maps had respective overall accuracies of 88 and 86.7%, user’s accuracies for the cropland class of 61.2 and 78.9%, and producer’s accuracies of 67.3 and 58.2%. An unbiased area estimate calculated from the map reference sample indicates that cropland covers 17.1% (15.4–18.9%) of Ghana. Using the most accurate validation labels to correct for biases in the segmented field boundaries map, we estimated that the average size and total number of field in Ghana are 1.73 ha and 1,662,281, respectively. Our results demonstrate an adaptable and transferable approach for developing annual, country-scale maps of crop field boundaries, with several features that effectively mitigate the errors inherent in remote sensing of smallholder-dominated agriculture.

abstract={Dynamic traffic in a software-defined network (SDN) causes explosive data to flow from one system to another. The explosive data affects the functionality of system parameters, network-level configuration, routing parameters, network characteristics, and system load factors. Adapting to the traffic flow is a key research area in SDN in today's big data world. Load balance vehicular sensor accessibility reduces delays, lowers energy consumption, and decreases the execution time. This paper combines the entropy-based active learning model to identify intrusion patterns efficiently, which is a packet-level intrusion detection model. The developed afterload balancing model can track the attack on the network. We then proposed a load balancing algorithm that optimizes the vehicular sensor usability by using sensor computing capability and source needs. We make use of a convergence-based mechanism to achieve high resource utilization. We then perform experiments on the state-of-the-art intrusion detection dataset. Our experimental results show that the load balancing mechanism can achieve 2× in performance improvements compared to traditional approaches. Thus, we can see that the designed model can help improve the decision boundary by increasing the training instance through pooling strategy and entropy uncertainty measure. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={This paper shares our three years of experience in conducting collaborative-based cybersecurity teaching involving industrial-expertise sharing and an authentic-learning environment. Penetration testing (pen-testing) is widely adopted in the cybersecurity industry. It requires a wide range of skillsets, including non-technical aspects, which are not easy to be acquired in a standard lecture-style setting. While the fundamentals of the skillsets could be taught separately in different modules, an integrated pen-testing module using real-world target applications will provide students with a bird’s-eye view of security assessment in an authentic learning setting. There exist, however, challenges in providing a sustainable structured pen-testing module. These include the evolving industrial best practices and availability of authentic target environments. In this paper, we share our experience as well as best practices in designing and teaching a pen-testing module in our Bachelor of Computing degree program. The module unconventionally adopts a fruitful win-win collaborative paradigm. The students, guided along by professional pen-testers from the industry and academic instructors, pen-test our University’s operational applications selected by the University IT Department. With the completed six semesters to date, our students have tested various applications, including our University’s learning management system, student registration system, and student-hall dining system, which all manage sensitive data. We have received very positive feedback from the parties involved. This paper describes our module’s rationale, involved parties and roles, class arrangements and activities, as well as grading considerations. The paper also discusses encountered issues and our adopted solutions related to University application selection, student contribution assessment, and activity arrangements during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some notes are additionally given for others who are keen to offer similar modules using the same teaching pedagogy. Our experience thus demonstrates that, while provisioning industrial collaboration and authentic learning in education needs to address several technical and administrative issues, a collaborative based teaching paradigm can work well in a sustainable manner. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Based on the Dunning–Kruger effect, comparing all positive answers to KA and IA questions with the self-assessment answer showed that 51% of first-year students provided positive answers with a 50% self-assessment rate, indicating a balanced self-assessment. The percentage of positive answers for the second-year students totaled 51%, with a 70% self-assessment rate, indicating overassessment. The percentage of positive answers totaled 82% for the third-year students, with a 62% self-assessment rate, indicating underassessment. To help students to become proficient requires balancing theory and experience, classroom and practice, where they incorporate a “student-as-instructor” modality to the entire curriculum, not only to the limited selected courses of the special forces training. Using the active learning technique helps students to gain exposure to a stimulating and interactive environment. We stress a teaching modality that includes learning by doing and having the student act as a teacher. In this role, participants maximize their learning through interoceptive awareness, feeling, and applying course material in a more comprehensively factual setting. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Abstract: Cyber security issues are always worthy of attention. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of approaches used to protect computer system and identify potential attack. However, existing methods are limited by high-dimensional computational complexity in rare or unknown attack detection task. To improve the ability of detecting anomaly intrusions, a hybrid intrusion detection framework is proposed in this paper. The proposed RuleRCD algorithm first uses fuzzy association rules based on Apriori and K-Means algorithm for normal pattern and major attack detection. The other data are then fed to an active learning-based rare category detection algorithm to identify its attack pattern. This paper also introduces an interactive visualization system, which integrates experts’ decision into intrusion detection workflow. The method improves the effectiveness and interpretability of detection process. KDD-99 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed framework. The result shows that the approach outperforms some methods, especially in terms of the rare attack.

abstract={The rumors, advertisements and malicious links are spread in social networks by social spammers, which affect users’ normal access to social networks and cause security problems. Most methods aim to detect social spammers by various features, such as content features, behavior features and relationship graph features, which rely on a large-scale labeled data. However, labeled data are lacking for training in real world, and manual annotating is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method which combines active learning algorithm with co-training algorithm to make full use of unlabeled data. In co-training, user features are divided into two views without overlap. Classifiers are trained iteratively with labeled instances and the most confident unlabeled instances with pseudo-labels. In active learning, the most representative and uncertain instances are selected and annotated with real labels to extend labeled dataset. Experimental results on the Twitter and Apontador datasets show that our method can effectively detect social spammers in the case of limited labeled data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework to reduce the vulnerability of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoon under cyber attacks. An observer-based autonomous resilient control strategy is first designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. Rigorous proof of the safety conditions of the platoon under V2V cyber attacks is derived. Next, to facilitate human supervision in emergencies and uncertainties, a decision-making aid system is developed, which consists of an anomaly reporting system (ARS), a trust-based information management system (TIMS), and a graphical user interface (GUI). ARS is designed to detect the abnormality of the neighbor UGVs based on the model-based residual generation and analysis. TIMS is developed to rule out information with low trustworthiness, which is fulfilled by a Bayesian-based information pre-processor followed by an enhanced median filter with trustworthiness regulation. It is rigorously proved that TIMS can recover the tempered information under the mild cyber attack scenario autonomously. To deal with unexpected severe vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) cyber attacks, human observations can also be leveraged to bolster the resilience of the TIMS. Representative simulation and humans-in-the-loop experiment (fulfilled by the designed GUI) demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively guide human operators when working with UGV platoons under cyber attacks. On average, compared to a multi-screen surveillance benchmark approach, the proposed framework can achieve 78.4&#x0025; decrements of platoon vulnerability and 39.0&#x0025; decrements in human workload.

The game befits a single 50-minute class period with introduction, gameplay, and discussion. The game can supplement the study of conflict from classic Cold War case studies of crisis bargaining, to arms control, or negotiating international protocols for global climate change such as the Paris Agreement. The Brinkmanship Game was developed for the seventh week of a 10-week graduate course called Game Theory and Decisionmaking: Exploring Strategic Situations. The course features a flipped classroom with class time devoted to experimentation, gameplay, and discussion of readings and games; lectures are online. The Brinkmanship Game would be appropriate for students in any advanced undergraduate or graduate level course in international relations, security studies, negotiation, or game theory. The Brinkmanship Game provides an active learning opportunity that can be valuable for encouraging students to come to their own understanding of concepts of mutual risk-taking. The authors have found the game to be effective in the classroom and hope it may prove valuable to those searching for ways to motivate students and to help them learn. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Among the wide variety of malicious behavior commonly observed in modern social platforms, one of the most notorious is the diffusion of fake news, given its potential to influence the opinions of millions of people who can be voters, consumers, or simply citizens going about their daily lives. In this paper, we implement and carry out an empirical evaluation of a version of the recently-proposed NETDER architecture for hybrid AI decision-support systems with the capability of leveraging the availability of machine learning modules, logical reasoning about unknown objects, and forecasts based on diffusion processes. NETDER is a general architecture for reasoning about different kinds of malicious behavior such as dissemination of fake news, hate speech, and malware, detection of botnet operations, prevention of cyber attacks including those targeting software products or blockchain transactions, among others. Here, we focus on the case of fake news dissemination on social platforms by three different kinds of users: non-malicious, malicious, and botnet members. In particular, we focus on three tasks: (i) determining who is responsible for posting a fake news article, (ii) detecting malicious users, and (iii) detecting which users belong to a botnet designed to disseminate fake news. Given the difficulty of obtaining adequate data with ground truth, we also develop a testbed that combines real-world fake news datasets with synthetically generated networks of users and fully-detailed traces of their behavior throughout a series of time points. We designed our testbed to be customizable for different problem sizes and settings, and make its code publicly available to be used in similar evaluation efforts. Finally, we report on the results of a thorough experimental evaluation of three variants of our model and six environmental settings over the three tasks. Our results clearly show the effects that the quality of knowledge engineering tasks, the quality of the underlying machine learning classifier used to detect fake news, and the specific environmental conditions have on smart policing efforts in social platforms. © 2021},

abstract={In recent years, enterprises have been targeted by advanced adversaries who leverage creative ways to infiltrate their systems and move laterally to gain access to critical data. One increasingly common evasive method is to hide the malicious activity behind a benign program by using tools that are already installed on user computers. These programs are usually part of the operating system distribution or another user-installed binary, therefore this type of attack is called "Living-Off-The-Land". Detecting these attacks is challenging, as adversaries may not create malicious files on the victim computers and anti-virus scans fail to detect them. We propose the design of an Active Learning framework called LOLAL for detecting Living-Off-the-Land attacks that iteratively selects a set of uncertain and anomalous samples for labeling by a human analyst. LOLAL is specifically designed to work well when a limited number of labeled samples are available for training machine learning models to detect attacks. We investigate methods to represent command-line text using word-embedding techniques, and design ensemble boosting classifiers to distinguish malicious and benign samples based on the embedding representation. We leverage a large, anonymized dataset collected by an endpoint security product and demonstrate that our ensemble classifiers achieve an average F1 score of 96% at classifying different attack classes. We show that our active learning method consistently improves the classifier performance, as more training data is labeled, and converges in less than 30 iterations when starting with a small number of labeled instances. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Prior experience from the authors has shown that a heavily theoretical approach for cybersecurity training has multiple shortcomings, mostly due to the demanding and diversified nature of the prerequisites, often involving concepts about operating system design, networking and computer architecture, among others. In such circumstances, the quest for trainee engagement often turns into a delicate balancing act between managing their expectations and providing an adequate progression path. In this perspective, hands-on exercises and contact with high-fidelity environments play a vital part in fostering interest and promoting a rewarding learning experience. Making this possible requires having the ability to design and deploy different use case training scenarios in a flexible way, tailored to the specific needs of classroom-based, blended or e-learning teaching models. This paper presents a flexible framework for the creation of laboratory and cyber range environments for training purposes, detailing the development, implementation and exploration of a cyber range scenario, within the scope of a course on cyber-physical systems security. Moreover, the course structure, curricular aspects and teaching methods are also detailed, as well as the feedback obtained from the students. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={With the development of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), Artificial Intelligence technology is widely used in many research areas, such as image classification, speech recognition, and information retrieval. Traditional supervised machine learning obtains labels from high-quality oracles, which is high cost and time-consuming and does not consider security. Since multi-label active learning becomes a hot topic, it is more challenging to train efficient and secure classification models, and reduce the label cost in the field of IIoT. To address this issue, this research focuses on the secure multi-label active learning for IIoT using an economical and efficient strategy called crowdsourcing, which involves querying labels from multiple low-cost annotators with various expertise on crowdsourcing platforms rather than relying on a high-quality oracle. To eliminate the effects of annotation noise caused by imperfect annotators, we propose the Multi-label Active Learning from Crowds (MALC) method, which uses a probabilistic model to simultaneously compute the annotation consensus and estimate the classifier's parameters while also taking instance similarity into account. Then, to actively choose the most informative instances and labels, as well as the most reliable annotators, an instance-label-annotator triplets selection technique is proposed. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that the performance of MALC is superior to existing methods. © 2021},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IoT systems are nowadays commonly designed as self-adaptive, endowing them with the ability to dynamically reconFigure to reflect their changing environment. This adaptation concerns also the security, as one of the most important properties of these systems. Though the state of the art on adaptivity in terms of security related to these systems can often deal well with fully anticipated situations in the environment, it becomes a challenge to deal with situations that are not or only partially anticipated. This uncertainty is however omnipresent in these systems due to humans in the loop, open-endedness and only partial understanding of the processes happening in the environment. In this paper, we partially address this challenge by featuring an approach for tackling access control in face of partially unanticipated situations. We base our solution on special kind of aspects that build on existing access control system and create a second level of adaptation that addresses the partially unanticipated situations by modifying access control rules. The approach is based on our previous work where we have analyzed and classified uncertainty in security and trust in such systems and have outlined the idea of access-control related situational patterns. The aspects that we present in this paper serve as means for application-specific specialization of the situational patterns. We showcase our approach on a simplified but real-life example in the domain of Industry 4.0 that comes from one of our industrial projects. © 2021 IEEE.},

However, testbeds have scarce human resources to develop documentation or support users one-on-one. Therefore, using testbeds can be difficult, especially for novice users. A user's lack of experience, coupled with user support deficiencies, can turn into research or learning obstacles. In this paper we report on two surveys we administered to investigate and document possible obstacles in user interaction with network testbeds. In the first survey we conducted interviews with 13 students that used a network testbed in class. Informed by their answers, we created the second, more comprehensive online survey and circulated it to both research and education users of network testbeds. We received 69 responses. User responses indicate three broad sources of usability challenges: orientational-learning a new environment, implementational-setting up and running experiments and domain-specific-monitoring experiments and diagnosing failures. Responses further show that most users overcome their initial orientational obstacles, but that implementational and domain-specific obstacles remain and should be addressed by testbeds through significant new developments. Overall, users regard network testbeds as a positive and useful influence on their learning and research. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The global Cybersecurity skill gap in 2020 is about 3.1 million and the Cybersecurity staff shortage is about 69%. Universities are waking up to the need for developing skills in Cybersecurity. Though many Universities offer a master's degree in Cybersecurity, it is impractical to fill this huge demand for Cybersecurity through only graduate degree holders. After careful analysis, it has become evident that there is a gap in the curriculum as it relates to training for Cybersecurity concepts in foundational computing courses for students. To be more specific, there is relatively less focus on the infusion of Cybersecurity concepts in undergraduate computing courses and its impact on classroom practices. This paper serves to address this gap by providing an experience in infusing, teaching, and assessing Cybersecurity modules in various undergraduate computing courses that immerse students in real-world Cybersecurity practices through active learning. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={With the fast growth of system complexity, it is increasingly difficult to comprehensively analyze security of such large-scale systems, which is a knowledge-intensive task. Although there are various available security knowledge sources, they are not well-connected with each other due to their heterogeneity and unstructured descriptions. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to construct a comprehensive and reusable knowledge graph in the field of information security. Specifically, we first investigate heterogeneous security knowledge sources and establish a detailed ontology of information security, integrating various security conceptual models. Then, we train a security entity identifier based on active learning to extract security knowledge from unstructured descriptions. Such extracted knowledge is then fused to establish a comprehensive and reusable security knowledge graph based on the unified ontology. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our established knowledge graph with a set of exemplary queries and reasoning rules in the context of a real security scenario. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Intrusion detection is a traditional practice of security experts, however, there are several issues which still need to be tackled. Therefore, in this paper, after highlighting these issues, we present an architecture for a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for an adaptive and incremental detection of both known and unknown attacks. The IDS is composed of supervised and unsupervised modules, namely, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, respectively. The proposed system is near-autonomous since the intervention of the expert is minimized through the active learning (AL) approach. A query strategy for the labeling process is presented, it aims at teaching the supervised module to detect unknown attacks and improve the detection of the already-known attacks. This teaching is achieved through sliding windows (SW) in an incremental fashion where the DNN is retrained when the data is available over time, thus rendering the IDS adaptive to cope with the evolutionary aspect of the network traffic. A set of experiments was conducted on the CICIDS2017 dataset in order to evaluate the performance of the IDS, promising results were obtained. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid evolution of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) introduces the healthcare ecosystem into a new reality consisting of smart medical devices and applications that provide multiple benefits, such as remote medical assistance, timely administration of medication and real-time monitoring. However, despite the valuable advantages, this new reality increases the cybersecurity and privacy concerns since vulnerable IoMT devices can access and handle autonomously patients' data. Furthermore, the continuous evolution of cyberattacks, malware and zero-day vulnerabilities require the development of the appropriate countermeasures. In the light of the aforementioned remarks, in this paper, we present an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), which can protect the healthcare communications that rely on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). HTTP is commonly adopted by conventional healthcare-related services, such as web-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) applications, while Modbus/TCP is an industrial protocol adopted by IoMT. Although the Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods have already demonstrated their efficacy in detecting intrusions, the rarely available intrusion detection datasets (especially in the healthcare sector) complicate their global application. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that an active learning approach is modelled and adopted in order to re-train dynamically the supervised classifiers behind the proposed IDPS. The evaluation analysis demonstrates the efficiency of this work against HTTP and Modbus/TCP cyberattacks, showing also how the entire accuracy is increased in the various re-training phases. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Controller Area Network (CAN) is an in-vehicle communication protocol, which provides an efficient and reliable communication link between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in real time. Recent studies have shown that attackers can take remote control of the targeted vehicle by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the CAN protocol. Motivated by this fact, we propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), called Clock Offset-based IDS (COIDS), to monitor in-vehicle network activities to detect any intrusion. Precisely, COIDS measures and then exploits the clock offset of transmitter ECU's clock for fingerprinting ECU. COIDS next leverages the derived fingerprints to construct a baseline of ECU's normal clock behavior using an active learning technique. Based on the baseline of normal behavior, COIDS uses the Cumulative Sum method to detect any abnormal deviation in clock offset. Further, COIDS uses a sequential change-point detection technique to determine the exact time of intrusion. Generally, COIDS has to run on every ECU to monitor the network behavior. This can turn out to be a significant power overhead for a hardware-constrained ECU. Thus, we next develop a cooperative game model to optimize the active time duration of COIDS in an ECU. We performed exhaustive experiments on real world publicly available datasets primarily to assess the effectiveness of COIDS against a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks. Our results show that COIDS detects intrusions faster than the best performed IDS in the state-of-the-art. Further, the results show that our designed cooperative game model significantly reduces the power overhead of the ECU without compromising the performance. © 2021},

Therefore, a Chinese word segmentation approach based on dictionary and semi-supervised conditional random field (SS-CRF ) is presented. At first, a CRF model for CWS is trained with self-training and active learning algorithms and used to conduct CWS task.

abstract={Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has made significant strides in the last decade and is now beginning to increase coverage of the system life cycle and in the process generating many more digital artifacts. The MBSE community today recognizes the need for a flexible frame-work to efficiently organize, access, and manage MBSE artifacts; create and use digital twins for verification and validation; facilitate comparative evaluation of system models and algorithms; and assess system performance. This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several compo-nents, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop control concepts and architectures. Key findings and lessons learned are presented along with a discussion of future directions. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In SDN anomaly detection systems, when a training mechanism adopts semi-supervised learning (consisting of self-training and self-learning) to attain the classifiers of online training, it may cause the accumulation of identification errors - to degrade the performance. This paper presents a new training and learning mechanism which involves the operations of self-training and active learning to solve the problem. The proposed mechanism first adds samples with “high confidence weights” and classified as “malicious” to the training set by random selection. It then practices active learning to label those samples with “low confidence weights” and add them to the training set for training, to further lift up identification accuracy. A faster clustering method has been brought in to reduce the operation time of active learning. In classifier retraining, parallel training is applied to keep the classifier in constant service without interruption. Simulation results show that, in contrast to existing active learning IDS (ALIDS), our new mechanism performs better in identifying unknown attacks, without occupying the operation time of detection as it processes both training and detection in parallel. © 2021 Institute of Information Science.

abstract={The political-military crisis of 2013 destroyed the Central African education system. Armed groups occupy 80% of the territory. They often use school buildings as base camps, playgrounds as shooting ranges and transform desks and chairs into firewood. Due to insecurity, most of the qualified teachers have abandoned their posts to stay in Bangui, the capital of the country. School-Age children are left to their own devices without education. This constitutes a danger to peace, security and the socio-economic development of the country. Going to school, learning to read and write is a right that all children should enjoy. In this article, we propose a digital elementary school solution in conflict areas with moodlebox to enable these children to learn with the assistance of the teachers-parents. The methodological approach of our solution is based on the use of raspberry pi 3 b+ on which we deploy moodle for all elementary school classes. The solution does not need the Internet or network infrastructure to work. Each student is equipped with a tablet that allows him/her to connect to the digital elementary school platform via Wi-Fi. Teachers recruited and trained in these areas provide the necessary support for children to master the digital tools for their education, and the teaching model is based on active learning. Course content is prepared by qualified teachers and integrated on the platform. This solution contributes on the one hand to the mastery of Information and Communication Technologies for Education by primary school students in a constantly changing technological environment; on the other hand to the improvement of schooling, the consolidation of peace, security and socio-economic development, thus facilitating the emergence of good governance and democracy in Central Africa. © 2021 Global IT Research Institute (GiRI).},

abstract={Face anti-fraud attack detection is mainly to help the face recognition system determine whether the collected face is the user's face or a printed photo, recorded video, 3D mask and other forgeries, so it is also called liveness detection. This technology is essential for the security of mobile phone unlocking, access control, and face payment. So how to automatically and efficiently distinguish the authenticity of images and resist spoofing attacks to ensure system security has become an urgent problem in face recognition technology. This article aims to study the application of active learning in face detection. Through the third-party library of python video processing, from six (three real faces, three fake faces) videos, three kinds of face images of different races and different ages are intercepted. Then through the CNN network, pool-based active learning was constructed, and it was run on the colab platform. By comparing the results obtained by selecting an example with a smaller LMU value and randomly selecting an example, the superiority of the LMU algorithm was shown, and after 350 epochs on the self-made data set, the accuracy rate is close to 90%, and as the training continues, the accuracy rate will be further improved. © 2021 IEEE.Allrights reserved},

abstract={Intrusion Detection Systems employ anomaly detection algorithms to detect malicious or unauthorized activities in real time. Anomaly detection algorithms that exploit artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently gained particular interest. These algorithms are usually evaluated and compared through effectiveness measures, which aim to quantify how well anomalies are identified based on detection capabilities. However, to the best of our knowledge, the performance characterization from the perspective of computational cost and space, training time, memory consumption, together with a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between algorithm effectiveness and performance, have not been explored yet. In this work, we select four recently proposed unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms based on ANN, namely: REPresentations for a random nEarest Neighbor (REPEN), DevNet, OmniAnomaly, Multi-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (MO-GAAL); we perform a variety of experiments to evaluate the trade-offs between the effectiveness and performance of the selected algorithms using two reference dataset: NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS-2017. Our results confirm the importance of this study, showing that none of the selected algorithms dominate the others in terms of both, effectiveness and performance. Furthermore, it shows that approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks, which exploit the temporal dependency of the samples, have a clear advantage over the others in terms of effectiveness, while exhibiting the worst execution time. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Intrusion alerts continue to grow in volume, variety, and complexity. Its cryptic nature requires substantial time and expertise to interpret the intended consequence of observed malicious actions. To assist security analysts in effectively diagnosing what alerts mean, this work develops a novel machine learning approach that translates alert descriptions to intuitively interpretable Action-Intent-Stages (AIS) with only 1% labeled data. We combine transfer learning, active learning, and pseudo labels and develop the Pseudo-Active Transfer Learning (PATRL) process. The PATRL process begins with an unsupervised-trained language model using MITRE ATTCK, CVE, and IDS alert descriptions. The language model feeds to an LSTM classifier to train with 1% labeled data and is further enhanced with active learning using pseudo labels predicted by the iteratively improved models. Our results suggest PATRL can predict correctly for 85% (top-1 label) and 99% (top-3 labels) of the remaining 99% unknown data. Recognizing the need to build confidence for the analysts to use the model, the system provides Monte-Carlo Dropout Uncertainty and Pseudo-Label Convergence Score for each of the predicted alerts. These metrics give the analyst insights to determine whether to directly trust the top-1 or top-3 predictions and whether additional pseudo labels are needed. Our approach overcomes a rarely tackled research problem where minimal amounts of labeled data do not reflect the truly unlabeled data's characteristics. Combining the advantages of transfer learning, active learning, and pseudo labels, the PATRL process translates the complex intrusion alert description for the analysts with confidence. © 2021 IEEE.},

Hence, we propose a conceptual framework called 'Human-in-the-Loop Explainable-AI-Enabled Vulnerability Detection, Investigation, and Mitigation' (HXAI-VDIM). Specifically, instead of resolving complex scenario of security vulnerabilities as an output of an AI/ML model, we integrate the security analyst or forensic investigator into the man-machine loop and leverage explainable AI (XAI) to combine both AI and Intelligence Assistant (IA) to amplify human intelligence in both proactive and reactive processes. Our goal is that HXAI-VDIM integrates human and machine in an interactive and iterative loop with security visualization that utilizes human intelligence to guide the XAI-enabled system and generate refined solutions. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The subgraph matching problem arises in a number of modern machine learning applications including segmented images and meshes of 3D objects for pattern recognition, bio-chemical reactions and security applications. This graph-based problem can have a very large and complex solution space especially when the world graph has many more nodes and edges than the template. In a real use-case scenario, analysts may need to query additional information about template nodes or world nodes to reduce the problem size and the solution space. Currently, this query process is done by hand, based on the personal experience of analysts. By analogy to the well-known active learning problem in machine learning classification problems, we present a machine-based active learning problem for the subgraph match problem in which the machine suggests optimal template target nodes that would be most likely to reduce the solution space when it is otherwise overly large and complex. The humans in the loop can then include additional information about those target nodes. We present some case studies for both synthetic and real world datasets for multichannel subgraph matching. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={This innovative practice full paper describes our experiences conducting cybersecurity capture the flag (CTF) competition for cybersecurity enthusiast participants (inclusive of both tertiary students and working professionals) local and abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning and appreciation of cybersecurity concepts for our participants with little to no technical background can be challenging. Gamification methods such as capture the flag competition style is a popular form of cybersecurity education to help participants overcome this challenge and identify talents. Participants get to apply theoretical concepts in a controlled environment, solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting and gain hands-on active learning experience. CTF competitions can be held at physical locations or virtually. However, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyses all major events that are traditionally held physically to go virtual (likewise for physical CTF events). The pandemic limits our physical interactions, changes the dynamics of our engagements with the participants and how participants learn. We have to adapt our CTF competition design and conduct it in a virtual format during the COVID-19 pandemic that is compliant with local pandemic regulations as well. This paper describes these adaptations for a semi-international CTF competition conducted for our participants. We conduct the competition entirely virtual and adapt the cybersecurity exercises to be attempted without the participant's physical presence. While we devise ways to validate participants' involvement, it is still more challenging to limit cheating than in a physical environment. However, with appropriate mitigating controls in place (reducing risks to acceptable levels), we were able to achieve similar outcomes compared to a physical event despite the lack of physical interactions. Over 1400 participants registered for our competition, and with the help of over 40 staff, we successfully conducted this 48 hours virtual CTF competition. We further analyse the participants' online activity during the competition, their survey responses after the competition and derive our lessons learnt. We hope that these experiences, analysis and findings are useful for educators or organisers who wish to adopt online CTF to improve the learning outcomes of teaching cybersecurity education. © 2021 IEEE.},

This makes it even harder to analyze the risk created by a vulnerability disclosure in the context of a specific information system. Instead of basing the risk analysis of a newly disclosed vulnerability on a possibly obsolete list of components, we focus on the security team members tasked with protecting the information system, by studying how Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and their subordinates actually react to vulnerability disclosures.

abstract={An effective cyber-security training calls for change of behaviour that requires more than providing information about risks and reactive behaviours as in existing instructional approach. This involves complementing traditional lectures with active learning experiences. The young learners that are exposed to digital technologies all their lives, often referred to as'Millennials' (Brinkworth et al, 2009) are not particularly motivated by traditional, one-way lecture/presentation-based learning within the classroom setting. Consequently, there is an increasing pressure on educators to promote student engagement by being not just deliverers of content, but facilitators of the learning process (Hamari et al, 2004). This is often accomplished through active learning strategies such as the flipped classroom, technology integration and use of game-based learning methods. In this paper, we present the design considerations for developing game-based learning resources for cyber security education within the higher education setting. The discussion in this paper is based on the experience of designing a cyber security game for a second-year cyber security module to introduce concepts penetration testing and information gathering to students. The paper explores the challenges in designing a game-based learning resource for cyber security education. The particular focus is on the impact of using game jams and student-centric co-creation methods in game design. The paper further elaborates on how the learning objectives and pedagogical intent were mapped to the appropriate game mechanics during the game design process ensuring the game-based learning resource do not compromise on learning. The paper presents initial results of field-trialling the game among 16-17 year old learners. © The Authors, 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in military reconnaissance, smart transportation, public security and other fields. UAV-based person tracking is attracting incremental attention for its wide application requirements. Currently, some state-of-the-art visual tracking methods have achieved promising performance in common scenarios. However, in the scene of UAV-based person tracking, there will be long-term target disappearance and unpredictable dramatic target appearance changes, which still pose a huge challenge to UAV-based person tracking. In this work, a human-machine hybrid augmented tracking system based on eye tracking is proposed to cope with the challenge. During tracking, through the interaction between humans and machines, humans can provide real-time guidance and corrections to the tracker, and the tracker can also learn interesting targets from humans to enhance itself. The experimental results show that human-in-the-loop can remarkable improve the success rate and robustness of the tracking and our tracking system outperforms the state-of-the-art tracker in complex environments. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increase in cyber-attacks, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has become a hot topic. Log detection using Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to detect critical risks, such as compromised internal hosts, is the most common use scenario for CTI. Recognition of the IOC is an important method to defend against cyber-attacks and is mainly divided into regular expression matching and supervised learning. However, regular expression matching does not consider contextual semantic information, resulting in low recognition accuracy, and the-state-of-the-art method is to train a neural network by supervised learning, which relies on a large amount of manually labeled data. To address these issues, we propose a QBC inconsistency-based sample selection strategy Query Committee Inconsistency (QCI) to select hard samples, that is, samples with poor model performance, more efficiently by combining committee inconsistency on sample entropy and sample similarity. The experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces the number of labeled samples required by the model by 62% and 39%, respectively, while maintaining accuracy, compared to the traditional QBC and QBC-based sample selection strategies using consistent entropy. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={A total of 34% of AI research and development projects fail or are abandoned, according to a recent survey by Rackspace Technology of 1,870 companies. In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top n potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company's risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a practical tool for managers and lead developers. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Information security is in dire need of qualified graduates with the ability to hit the ground running. Yet IS courses in InfoSec management struggle to simply present the breadth of topics available, let alone give students adequate opportunities to practice those skills. Existing literature offers little guidance for instructors to design an applied course in InfoSec management. To address this gap and student needs, we redesigned the InfoSec management course by incorporating an agile framework. This redesign provides avenues for students to acquire technology and soft skills and practice honing those skills, thereby increasing the relevance of the course and producing graduates able to fill the myriad of job openings in the field of information security. The initial analyses of student survey responses are positive, lending support to the effectiveness of the course redesign and contributing in a meaningful way to the IS pedagogy literature. This paper will interest instructors and researchers in information security. © AMCIS 2021.},

abstract={Receiving relevant information on possible cyber threats, attacks, and data breaches in a timely manner is crucial for early response. The social media platform Twitter hosts an active cyber security community. Their activities are often monitored manually by security experts, such as Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). We thus propose a Twitter-based alert generation system that issues alerts to a system operator as soon as new relevant cyber security related topics emerge. Thereby, our system allows us to monitor user accounts with significantly less workload. Our system applies a supervised classifier, based on active learning, that detects tweets containing relevant information. The results indicate that uncertainty sampling can reduce the amount of manual relevance classification effort and enhance the classifier performance substantially compared to random sampling. Our approach reduces the number of accounts and tweets that are needed for the classifier training, thus making the tool easily and rapidly adaptable to the specific context while also supporting data minimization for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Relevant tweets are clustered by a greedy stream clustering algorithm in order to identify significant events. The proposed system is able to work near real-time within the required 15-min time frameand detects up to 93.8% of relevant events with a false alert rate of 14.81%. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the increasing penetration of renewable energy, frequency response and its security are of significant concerns for reliable power system operations. Frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) is proposed to address this challenge. Despite existing efforts in modeling frequency characteristics in unit commitment (UC), current strategies can only handle oversimplified low-order frequency response models and do not consider wide-range operating conditions. This paper presents a generic data-driven framework for FCUC under high renewable penetration. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained to predict the frequency response using real data or high-fidelity simulation data. Next, the DNN is reformulated as a set of mixed-integer linear constraints to be incorporated into the ordinary UC formulation. In the data generation phase, all possible power injections are considered, and a region-of-interest active sampling is proposed to include power injection samples with frequency nadirs closer to the UFLC threshold, which enhances the accuracy of frequency constraints in FCUC. The proposed FCUC is investigated on the IEEE 39-bus system. Then, a full-order dynamic model simulation using PSS/E verifies the effectiveness of FCUC in frequency-secure generator commitments.

abstract={Transfer learning has achieved great success on the challenge of learning with insufficient labeled data, mainly by exploiting the knowledge from some other related domains. Common transfer learning methods require to access the data or pre-trained models from source domains, and thus are less applicable to tasks with privacy or security requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to reuse the posterior probabilities from source domains without data sharing. On one hand, the distribution of posterior probability is regularized by utilizing the source predications as well as limited target data; on the other hand, a sampling strategy based on distribution difference is designed to actively select the most valuable instances for label querying. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve effective performances and requires less labeled data. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Software feature requests are proposed by users online to ask for new features of software covering diverse aspects of software properties, such as usability, security, and performance. They are valuable sources of software requirements. Early detection of request categories enables them to be stored structurally and incorporated into requirements specifications. But manually analyzing and labeling the category of user requests is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to automatically classify user requests, where both statistical and semantical text features are adopted. The main contributions of this work are comparing the effectiveness of different deep learning algorithms in feature request classification and exploring the proper way to apply deep learning to solve the requests classification issue. Three research questions are answered by experiments to illustrate the contributions. The experimental results derived from the dataset collected from Sourceforge.net show that the deep classifier works properly on utilizing different types of features, classifying user requests, and combining with active learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Identifying rare categories is an important data management problem in many application fields including video surveillance, ecological environment monitoring and precision medicine. Previous solutions in literature require all data instances to be first delivered to the server. Then, the rare category identification algorithms are executed on the pool of data to find informative instances for human annotators to label. This incurs large bandwidth consumption and high latency. To deal with the problems, we propose a light-weight rare category identification framework. At the sensor side, the designed online algorithm filters less informative data instances from the data stream and only sends the informative ones to servers for annotating. After labeling, the server only sends labels of the corresponding data instances in response. The sensor-side algorithm is extended to enable cooperation between embedded devices for the cases that data is collected in a distributed manner. For enhancing diversity of selected data, a representative selection algorithm is proposed to run during the idle time of the system or after the execution of rare category identification algorithm. Experiments are conducted to show our framework dramatically outperforms the baseline. The network traffic is reduced by 75% on average. IEEE},

abstract={Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly deployed in complex application domains replacing human-decision making. While ML has been surprisingly successful, there are fundamental concerns in wide scale deployment without humans in the loop. A critical question is the trustworthiness of such ML systems. Although there is research towards making ML systems more trustworthy, there remain many challenges. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges and limitations of current proposals. We focus on a more adversarial approach, borrowing ideas from certification of security software with the Common Criteria. While it is unclear how to get strong trustworthy assurances for ML systems, we believe this approach can further increase the level of trust. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In data-driven big data security analysis, knowledge graph-based multisource heterogeneous threat data organization, association mining, and inference analysis attach increasinginterest in the field of cybersecurity. Although the construction of knowledge graph based on deep learning has achieved great success, the construction of a largescale, high-quality, and domain-specific knowledge graph needs a manual annotation of large corpora, which means it is very difficult. To tackle this problem, we present a straightforward active learning strategy for cybersecurity entity recognition utilizing deep learning technology. BERT pre-trained model and residual dilation convolutional neural networks (RDCNN) are introduced to learn entity context features, and the conditional random field (CRF) layer is employed as a tag decoder. Then, taking advantages of the output results and distribution of cybersecurity entities, we propose an active learning strategy named TPCL that considers the uncertainty, confidence, and diversity. We evaluated TPCL on the general domain datasets and cybersecurity datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that TPCL performs better than the traditional strategies in terms of accuracy and F1. Moreover, compared with the general field, it has better performance in the cybersecurity field and is more suitable for the Chinese entity recognition task in this field. © 2021 Bo Xie et al.},

abstract={Discovering potential concepts and events by analyzing Earth Observation (EO) data may be supported by fusing other distributed data sources such as non-EO data, for instance, in-situ citizen observations from social media. The retrieval of relevant information based on a target query or event is critical for operational purposes, for example, to monitor flood events in urban areas, and crop monitoring for food security scenarios. To that end, we propose an early-fusion (low-level features) and late-fusion (high-level concepts) mechanism that combines the results of two EU-funded projects for information retrieval in Sentinel imagery and social media data sources. In the early fusion part, the model is based on active learning that effectively merges Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands, and assists users to extract patterns. On the other hand, the late fusion mechanism exploits the context of other geo-referenced data such as social media retrieval, to further enrich the list of retrieved Sentinel image patches. Quantitative and qualitative results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={With the technical support of 5G, the drone network plays a critical role in the autonomous and digital era. However, due to wireless and autonomy characteristics, the drone network is prone to diverse malicious attacks, so it's vital to deploy network intrusion detection system to detect network attacks. For a real open drone network environment, unknown attacks will occur constantly, but the existing intrusion detection methods are usually designed for a static and closed-set scenario and will fail to recognize the unknown attacks correctly, threatening the security of drone network. Therefore, we design an intrusion detection system to detect unknown network attacks in the drone network. Based on open-set recognition, we propose the Open-CNN model to implement intrusion detection and detect unknown attacks. Further to detect unknown attacks, we also propose an active learning (AL) approach for unknown attacks based on the least confidence query strategy, allowing the intrusion detection model to learn efficiently from the unknown attack instances detected by Open-CNN at small labeling budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Open-CNN in detecting unknown attacks, with the accuracy improvement of 9% to 30% over the compared methods, and the proposed AL approach achieves good performance when retraining with only 1% of labeled unknown attack samples. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Described herein is an in-class exercise that challenges students to role-play government decision-makers in a stylized international system of states with no explicit revisionist aims, nor incentives for aggression. Decisionmakers must choose how to allocate resources between “guns” and “butter”, which seems a straightforward decision problem until uncertainty is amplified by defecting spies, who share information about neighboring states’ armament plans. The ensuing dynamics typically include arms racing and conflict spirals, thus illustrating the operation of the security dilemma, and providing the class with an opportunity to experience firsthand an emergent security dilemma, and to discuss its operation and implications for world politics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This essay outlines a set of mini-games designed to more effectively allow political science instructors, particularly in International Relations, teach basic principles and concepts associated with digital insecurity and cyber conflict. This topic, increasingly significant in IR syllabi in recent years, is in many cases considered with trepidation or uncertainty about the significance of different subjects within that might be covered. As a result, instructors often fall back on discussion of paradigm examples and fail to teach the underlying principles of function and logical design that give students insight into the security dynamics of the digital domain. Without such instruction, students in political science are less likely to act on interest in digital issues or science, technology and society topics more broadly. The games suggested herein are resources aimed at easing the challenge of providing such instruction and are accompanied by elaboration on student responses from three years of their use. These mini-games are extremely successful and, more importantly, simple and versatile enough that their incorporation in both introductory and intermediate IR syllabi is easy. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This article evaluates a “real-time” simulation where students role-play a United Nations Security Council negotiation over humanitarian intervention in Syria. This simulation is undertaken in a large introductory International Relations (IR) subject. The article argues that in order to achieve deep learning outcomes across the diverse, contemporary cohort of first-year university students, active learning approaches need to be employed that engage differing learning styles and preferences. Deep learning is assessed across the conceptual and metacognitive knowledge domains with two indicators: (1) students’ understanding of IR concepts by applying them beyond the parameters of the Syria case and (2) students’ critical reflection on their moral reasoning elicited by the task. We evaluate 820 students across six cohorts and 21 iterations of the simulation during 2016 and 2017 with a survey instrument and formal reflection assignment. The article finds that the simulation is highly effective at consistently engaging the majority of students’ interest and motivation, while illustrating the acute and sometimes tragic tension between moral and political reasoning in IR. We found that disrupting student’s cognitive structures regarding human rights and justice stimulated not only deeper conceptual understanding but also emotional reactions that were the catalyst for metacognitive reflection. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Distance learning is the education of students who may not often be physically present. Internet technology has made many possible ways of distance learning by open educational tools and services, such as e-learning and MOOCs. The distance learning technologies are divided into two types of delivery: synchronous learning and asynchronous learning. The two methods can be combined to create a hybrid learning model. In this work, we will discuss an adaptable hybrid teaching model we call it Zoom Sandwich. The model utilizes the benefits of both methods and integrates active learning techniques where students learn the concepts and topics online and then come to the classroom for application through interactive groups and class level discussions utilizing technology breakout rooms and chat platforms. We also consider the best practices to humanize online learning and increase students' and instructors' social presence. Covid-19 Pandemic changed the way institutions conduct business and provide services. To fight the spread of coronavirus, schools across the country have temporarily closed and transitioned to distance learning. This provided an opportunity for cybercriminals to hack and expose human vulnerabilities. We are proposing a set of security best practices and policies to countermeasures the cyberattacks. © 2020 IEEE.},

However, network protocol analysis is challenged by the problem of concept drift and class imbalance. Moreover, as the network traffic are arriving at high speed, it is also costly to label the traffic data in real time. In this paper, an ensemble online active learning method is proposed. To select the most representative samples and the minority class samples in the network traffic streams, the novel hybrid active learning labeling strategy based on predicted uncertainty and class imbalance ratio is proposed, which uses margin value as criterion and decision threshold based on the class imbalance ratio. To make full use of the labeled samples, a samples training weight adjustment mechanism is designed to enhance the performance of the ensemble classifier. Moreover, the drift detection mechanism is also integrated into the ensemble classifier to detect possible drift in the traffic stream and evolve the classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a good protocol identification ability especially on the minority class protocols. © 2020 IEEE.},

Researchers and instructional designers suggest these laboratory exercises are constructivist by nature and impart an active learning experience. However, students report an overtly objectivist perspective when asked about how they use the same laboratories. More specifically, whereas traditional laboratory exercise designs are theme parks in game design terms, the Cyber Engineering Learning Facility (CELF) is designed and implemented as a sandbox. To that end, the CELF uses the pedagogical concept of a phenomenarium and first principles of cyber science to engender a full stack Bloom's taxonomy experience. Preliminary results suggest the CELF design and implementation is operating as intended but with room for additional innovation. To that effect, we present analysis of the infrastructure utilization as well as analysis of student perceptions. Further, we discuss limitations of the current CELF design along with several avenues for future innovation. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={How do active learning environments—by means of simulations—enhance political science students’ learning outcomes regarding different levels of knowledge? This paper examines different UN simulations in political science courses to demonstrate their pedagogical value and provide empirical evidence for their effectiveness regarding three levels of knowledge (factual, procedural and soft skills). Despite comprehensive theoretical claims about the positive effects of active learning environments on learning outcomes, substantial empirical evidence is limited. Here, we focus on simulations to systematically test previous claims and demonstrate their pedagogical value. Model United Nations (MUNs) have been a popular teaching device in political science. To gain comprehensive data about the active learning effects of MUNs, we collect data and evaluate three simulations covering the whole range of simulation characteristics: a short in-class simulation of the UN Security Council, a regional MUN with different committees being simulated, and two delegations to the National Model United Nations, for which the students prepare for 1 year. Comparative results prove that simulations need to address certain characteristics in order to produce extensive learning outcomes. Only comprehensive simulations are able to achieve all envisioned learning outcomes regarding factual and procedural knowledge about the UN and soft skills. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This paper aims to answer the question if autoencoders, a type of semi-supervised feedforward neural network, can provide a low cost anomaly detector method for computer network data streams. Autoencoder methods were evaluated online with the KDD'99 and UNSW-NB15 data sets, demonstrating that running time and labeling cost are significantly reduced compared to traditional online classification techniques for similar detection performance. Further research would consider the trade-off between single vs stacked networks, multi-label classification, concept drift detection and active learning. © 2020 ACM.},

This outreach consortium is financed by the Department of Energy DOE, as well as the NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration). With this summer program, our objective is to serve advanced manufacturing, as evolving technology and to improve STEM education and prepare future engineers for the new challenges related to this new technology. The main objective is to teach the students the use of professional design tools made for today's designers and engineers, such as Autodesk Inventor, as well as the use of 3D printers. In addition, science, and math are integrated to show relationships and solve challenges related to several projects. The progressive level of the projects related to producing better parts, assemblies, and drawings mostly focuses on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions (problem-solving, writing, visual art, communication skills, and open-mindedness) to problems. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the consortium management and the use of the summer program as example to describe the methodology implemented, based on active learning, perform experimentation, and the use of software, such as Autodesk Inventor. In particular, we will discuss several activities performed during this summer camp. A collaborative work between an NCAT faculty and high school instructors have been developed over the years served for the success of this program. The high-school instructors, as well as the counselors, helped with the process, as well as with the learning process. Their participation was very useful in terms of addressing the appropriate pedagogy, communicating with high-school students, and keeping them focused and task.

abstract={3D printing is considered to be one of the most innovative technologies of the current century, with diverse applications in education, engineering, art, and design. We conducted a summer teaching class about advanced manufacturing and 3D printing. The project is financed by NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration), and the Department of Energy DOE. With our summer program, our objective is to serve advanced manufacturing, as evolving technology and to improve STEM education and prepare the new generation of high-school students (future engineers) by the use of the existing tools. Through the use of programs, such as CREO and Autodesk Inventor, as well as 3D printing concepts, we include both technology and basic traditional STEM knowledge, such as math and science. These tools allow the students to reach their objectives without going through complex mathematics and engineering concepts and methods. This way, these projects will mostly focus on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions to problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the design and implementation of an experiment, from basic parts. In particular, we will discuss several activities performed during this summer camp. This methodology is based on the understanding of the physical phenomena, perform experimentation, and the use of software, such as Autodesk Inventor. Our approach is based on active learning strategies, that emphasis comprehensive understanding, avoiding as possible all the complications of numerical and analytical mathematics needed for such level of study. Collaborations with high school instructors have been carried out and a methodology has been developed, based on a step by step learning method. At this moment, only two high-school instructors are involved. They enthusiastically help with the process, and at the same time, they are learning with the students, since they never had been exposed to such projects. Their presence was very useful in terms of addressing the appropriate pedagogy, communicating with high-school students, and controlling them in certain circumstances. Their presence is also available for the second explanation, where usually the first explanation from a university faculty is not completely appropriate with their level. Most importantly, the project methodology will be discussed. We discuss the project design program from students' point of view, and the experience earned in design, integration, and also in written and oral communication skills. The methodology used to evaluate the effectiveness of this design program in terms of learning outcomes is also described.

abstract={As ‘middle-power countries’ mature National Cyber Security policies and practices, many have identified a requirement for a military option for governments to either assist or lead cybersecurity responses. For a military force, this could place their operating methodology in a diarchy; the first being the protection and resilience of internal capability networks, the second having the capability to integrate into external networks, including critical infrastructure to defend national interests. Gaining this ability as an Army is not simply a role for the cyber specialist. For this to occur, organisational cyber resilience responses and cyber risk management practices must be established well before a cyber-incident. To meet such a national strategy, an Army must design, educate and train those forces that will undertake these roles both internally and externally to the organisation. Compared to civil industries, this could be akin to being a cybersecurity consumer and a cybersecurity service provider simultaneously; both requiring different business operating models ranging from Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) to Industrial Control System (IDS) security operations against a broad and varying threat array. This paper outlines research to define the nature of Cyber Risk Management and Cyber-Resilience for a Middle-Power Army, noting its likely internal and external requirements. It discusses those intrinsic attributes required for Cyber Risk Management and Cyber Resilience to inform workforce design and training. Finally, this paper proposes a workforce and skilling array design that is required to meet the various methodologies throughout Cyber Risk Management and Cyber-Resilience life-cycles for further experimentation. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

A lot has been written about safety and human error. There’s also been, for a long time, this thought that humans are the weakest link in security. If we could just take the human out of the loop, we would have safer systems, or more secure systems. Whether we are better off with or without the human in the loop, we cannot avoid people being part of security. And one way to keep people secure is to teach them something, and this is where the mental model comes in. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Widespread internet device use is simultaneously increasing individual cybersecurity risk. Individual awareness of cybersecurity risk must begin early, in high school and with a curriculum that engages the student’s interest in a highly technical topic. The research project presented here explores the best way to teach cybersecurity to high school students to accomplish these goals. Researchers developed and delivered cybersecurity lectures to the students weekly, observing that each lecture and activity caused a different reaction and interest level depending on the way the topic was approached. Results from this research show the best way to engage students in cybersecurity education topics, as measured by assessment using a brain computer interface (BCI). A curriculum with eight topics was prepared, with selected subjects providing an entry point for different learning styles. Active learning activities and student outcomes show the validity of this approach, as do pre- and post-survey assessments. The results from this work can be used to further develop appropriate engaging cybersecurity education, while reducing student stress. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Critical manufacturing processes in smart networked systems such as Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) typically require guaranteed quality-of-service performances, which is supported by cyber-security management. Currently, most existing vulnerability-assessment techniques mostly rely on only the security department due to limited communication between different working groups. This poses a limitation to the security management of CPPSs, as malicious operations may use new exploits that occur between successive analysis milestones or across departmental managerial boundaries. Thus, it is important to study and analyse CPPS networks’ security, in terms of vulnerability analysis that accounts for humans in the production process loop, to prevent potential threats to infiltrate through cross-layer gaps and to reduce the magnitude of their impact. We propose a semantic framework that supports the collaboration between different actors in the production process, to improve situation awareness for cyberthreats prevention. Stakeholders with different expertise are contributing to vulnerability assessment, which can be further combined with attack-scenario analysis to provide more practical analysis. In doing so, we show through a case study evaluation how our proposed framework leverages crucial relationships between vulnerabilities, threats and attacks, in order to narrow further the risk-window induced by discoverable vulnerabilities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Incident prioritization is nowadays a part of many approaches and tools for network security and risk management. However, the dynamic nature of the problem domain is often unaccounted for. That is, the prioritization is typically based on a set of static calculations, which are rarely adjusted. As a result, incidents are incorrectly prioritized, leading to an increased and misplaced effort in the incident response. A higher degree of automation could help to address this problem. In this paper, we explicitly consider flaws in the prioritization an unalterable circumstance. We propose an adaptive incident prioritization, which allows to automate certain tasks for the prioritization model management in order to continuously assess and improve a prioritization model. At the same time, we acknowledge the human analyst as the focal point and propose to keep the human in the loop, among others by treating understandability as a crucial requirement. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={A future challenge for the European air traffic system is an estimated rise in traffic load in combination with the occurrence of so-called disruptive events (e.g., thunderstorms, security alarms or union strikes). EUROCONTROL showed in their simulations that external events lead to instabilities in the whole European air traffic system with a weakened ability to recover [cf. (EUROCONTROL, Challenges of growth 2013—Task 6: the effect of air traffic network congestion 2035. EUROCONTROL, Brussels, 2013)]. Due to these events, EUROCONTROL estimates a strong increase of delay within the air traffic system, especially at the airports. Among various factors to keep the impact of these events minimized, a sufficient cooperation between the affected air traffic participants (pilots, controllers, airport staff, etc.) is necessary. Sharing information and aligning on a procedure to utilize the existing resources offers a way to efficiently keep up operations. A tool to train this cooperative behavior and to validate the benefits of new systems and procedures regarding the enforcement of cooperative behavior is a human-in-the-loop simulation (HITL). HITL simulations enable cooperative situations by facing the participants with disruptive events. These situations are commonly supported by so-called pseudo-actors, humans which take on one or multiple roles within the cooperation. Thereby the cooperation can be developed in a more or less challenging way. For instance, a delayed pilot reaction in dense traffic or an airline dispatcher not willing to cancel flights into a congested airport can be performed by a pseudo-actor. Currently, pseudo-actors with predefined instructions for their behavior are the only way to generate the above-mentioned challenges in HITL simulations. As human beings, the pseudo-actors show varying behavior. Therefore, reproducibility of the HITL simulation is limited, although being one of the key features. In contrast to field trials in a real environment all influencing factors of a HITL simulation are under control. Situations can be repeated multiple times. In terms of training simulation this is necessary to generate the intended learning effect. In terms of validation simulation the possibility to exactly repeat a situation is needed to compare a situation with the support of a new system (experimental condition) to one without the new system (baseline). This paper provides a contribution for assessing the potential of human pseudo-actor alternatives. Virtual agents are already used in other fields such as gaming and other types of simulation (e.g., virtual military training simulation). These virtual agents interact with the other human participants of the simulation. Moreover, as being computer applications, they strictly do follow their programmed behavior. Thus, they offer the benefit of reproducible behavior. The evaluation within this paper uses the airport management simulation of the German Aerospace Center to challenge four participants with multiple disruptive events. The role of the stand and gate allocation manager is either taken by a human pseudo-actor or a virtual agent. The results of the simulation runs with the human pseudo-actor are compared to the ones with the virtual agent. Analyzing the results a first conclusion on the potential of virtual agents in air traffic HITL simulations will be given. © 2018, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.},

abstract={Digital libraries, E-commerce brokers and similar vast information-oriented systems rely on consistent data to offer high-quality services. But presence of duplicates, quasi replicas, or near-duplicate entries (Dirty Data) in their repositories asperses their storage resources directly and delivery issues indirectly. Significant investments in this field from interested parties prompted the need for best methods for removing replicas from data repositories. Prior approaches involved using SVM classifiers, approaches to handle these dirty data. New distributed deduplication systems with higher reliability in which the data chunks are distributed across multiple cloud servers. The security requirements of data confidentiality and tag consistency are also achieved by introducing a deterministic secret sharing scheme in distributed storage systems, instead of using convergent encryption as in previous deduplication systems. So propose to use Unsupervised Duplicate Detection (UDD) Mechanism a query-dependent record matching method that requires no pre trained data set. UDD uses two cooperating classifiers that is, a weighted component similarity summing (WCSS) classifier and an SVM classifier that iteratively identifies duplicates in the query results from data sources. Achieves the same efficiency in terms of Deduplication results but significantly at a better performance rate (time) compared to GP systems. A practical implementation of the proposed approach validates the claim. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering & Sciences Publication. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Autonomy is defined in terms of the degree of capability of a system or machine to function without human intervention. Degrees of autonomy can vary from requiring fully engaged human involvement at one extreme to having none at the other extreme. Levels of trust on the part of humans concerns the extent of belief or confidence in the system. When a system with some degree of autonomy makes decisions and carries out its functions, trust in the system may rise or fall in accordance with perceptions or measurements of the system performance. Measurement of trust is typically related to ethical, moral, social and legal norms of society, along with metrics related to taking responsibility. Trust is related to cybersecurity in that insecure systems inherently have low trust. The work of this paper surveys and explores concepts of trust in terms of relationships between humans and systems. An ontology that characterizes this relationship is provided. Trust issues as they pertain to the areas of cybersecurity and autonomy are characterized. The concept of anti-autonomy and counter measures that apply to autonomous weapon systems is also included. © 2019 ISCA.},

Human, a complex component in CPS, contributes errors to the CPS due to human fatigue, behaviour and false sense of security. The proposed framework maximizes human performance by considering the human behavior and his/her health. A simulated water pouring task is performed to evaluate the performance of the framework.

abstract={This single lesson classroom game is designed to test student knowledge of Realist and Liberal concepts through an imbalanced resource bargaining mechanic. The game is designed for approximately 20 students divided into state teams of three to four students each and uses chocolate to represent the state teams’ economic capacity, military capability, and human security. Each state team had competing goals, over which they must cooperate or conflict for additional pieces. This game also uses an abstract design to maximize active learning through a short course of play while also making the game useful for testing concepts at any point in an International Relations course. In addition to offering a complete yet easily modifiable game for classroom use, this article also describes the game’s pedagogical contribution to the discipline, game design notes, and techniques for preventing students from stuffing their faces with game pieces. © 2018, This article not subject to United States copyright law.},

PDF (Portable Document Format) is a widely used file format, and often utilized as a vehicle for malicious behavior. In this paper, machine learning algorithm will be used to detect malicious PDF document, and evaluated on experimental data. The main work of this paper is to implement a malware detection method, which utilizes static pre-processing and machine learning algorithm for classification. During the period of classifying, the differences in structure and content between malicious and benign PDF files will be taken as the classification basis. What’s more, we boost training for the PDF malware classifier via active learning based on mutual agreement analysis. The detector is retrained according to the truth value of the uncertain samples, which can not only reduce the training time consumption of the detector, but also improve the detection performance. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Due to advances in automated vehicle technology and inter-vehicle communication, vehicular platoons have attracted a growing interest by academia and industry alike, as they can produce safe driving, regularize traffic flow, and increase throughput. Research has demonstrated, however, that when platoons are placed in an adversarial environment, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks that could negatively impact traffic flow and produce collisions and/or injuries. In this work, we consider an attack that seeks to exploit human-in-the-loop control of compromised vehicles that are part of a platoon. Specifically, we demonstrate that should a human operator need to suddenly take control of a platooned vehicle, significant upstream effects, which threaten the safety of passengers in other vehicles, may be induced. To counter this so-called disbanding attack, we present an optimal centralized mitigation approach. Due to scalability, security, and privacy concerns, such an approach may not be practical in reality. Hence, we also propose a decentralized mitigation algorithm that reduces excessive speed changes and coordinates inter-platoon behaviors to minimize the attack impacts. Our algorithm is compared to the aforementioned optimal approach and is shown to produce nearly equivalent results while requiring fewer resources. Experimental results on a hardware testbed show that our countermeasure permits graceful speed reductions and can provide safety, i.e., no collisions. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.},

abstract={The awareness about security threats and vulnerabilities in Air Traffic Management (ATM) has been steadily growing over the last years. The number of recent security research projects shows that the effort taken to close these vulnerabilities and to make air traffic more robust against security attacks is increasing in the same way. As Air Traffic Management is often done across national borders, related security incidents could affect several air navigation service providers and stakeholders in different nations at the same time. A quick and efficient exchange of security-relevant information as well as a multi-national level of security management is needed. In the frame of the Global ATM Security Management Project (GAMMA), several prototypic security systems were developed and designed as part of a European security management system architecture. This concept foresees a local, a national and a European level of security management while essential information is shared between those levels. In order to validate this approach, several real-time human-in-the-loop simulations were conducted in the first half of 2017. Both, the connected security systems and also the validation environment were set up in a geo-distributed way across Europe integrating different components from several project partners. During these trials, special attention was payed to information exchange and transmission times, the performance of automatic correlation as well as the role of human operators embedded in this system of systems. The trials showed that - even in a geo-distributed setup - information can be exchanged and countermeasures can be initiated in less than 2 minutes through the different levels of security management. This paper provides information about the experimental setup and conduction of the GAMMA project's third geo-distributed validation exercise. It illustrates selected results as well as provides a discussion and an outlook. © 2018 IEEE.},

The efforts have resulted towards identifying several security trends and challenges and some design aspects to be considered by IoT practitioners. The outcomes point towards that security is not only a technical problem but is more of an awareness, mindset, people and process issue. In this paper, a novel model is conceptualized with openness and security characteristics followed with several key aspects important to design an IoT system.

abstract={Cloud security is a key to both Cloud clients and vendors, and this has prodded intensified massive research around this domain. The contractual continuous Cloud security research is as well fuelled by the abrupt popping up of attacks that even extend to silent or stealth. Moreover these silent or stealth attacks are characterised by low observability along with bad traceability resulting in their difficulty detection, traceability and prevention. Due to the nature of silent or stealth attacks that have difficulty detection, traceability and prevention calibre, it means traditional and/or ordinary security mechanisms won't be sufficient to compact such attacks. In turn the nearby remedy to tackle these attacks is to incorporate method(s) that can curb trends that has hidden patterns. This then calls for techniques that have capabilities for revealing hidden patterns, thus Hidden Markov Model will find its projected usage in the proposed model. As a way to offer maximum security when dealing with these sophisticated kinds of attacks, a conjuncture of cryptography will also be fused in the proposed model. A logical series of actions will be executed such that once a possible attack is sensed, then a proactive action is triggered to avoid an invasion by this attack. The intelligence is derived from the previously learning by Hidden Markov Model, although continuous active learning is still guaranteed as this algorithm carries the Machine Learning algorithm standards, along with the proactive action is triggered. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of tabletop exercises (TTXs) in graduate nuclear security education, their effectiveness and their relationship to traditional forms of classroom instruction. The paper highlights both the benefits and challenges of TTX implementation—the former including higher student motivation and material retention, and the latter including motivational shifts toward “winning” and possible student exclusionary behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Survey results from 49 former students in a US university were collected electronically and combined with anecdotal evidence from student, facilitator and teaching assistant interviews following five iterations of a specifically designed, semester-long, TTX case study. The case study focused on securing a fictional nuclear facility. Findings: Students found the TTX more memorable and retained more course material when asked to compare the TTX’s effectiveness to long-term course projects in other courses. Their in-class motivations tended to shift from traditional classroom motivations toward “winning,” and “not letting down their classmates.” In some iterations, students also observed classmates becoming more tempted to cheat or otherwise violate academic ethics. Mitigation strategies to prevent such temptations (e.g. removing direct student vs student TTX structures) were found to be effective. Originality/value: This is the first report on the effective use of a semester-long TTX in a graduate nuclear security classroom. The flexibility of this instructional tool demonstrates its applicability to other classroom subjects including homeland security, emergency management, disease outbreak management and public policy among others. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The networks used in the Railway domain are usually heterogeneous, not enough protected and not fitted to the usual Cyber Security requirements in terms of sustainability, protection and attack detection. Furthermore, the quick evolution of the telecommunications, the threats and the sustainability aspects have to be taken into account in order to protect the Railway system. Cyber Security in general can be achieved through 2 main disposals: 1) a detection of threats from a monitoring of the environment followed by a detection of abnormal behaviors based on dedicated algorithms, and 2) an automatic system decides which reaction to take and finally apply this action (e.g. an alarm or a reconfiguration). Our approach aims at answering the questions: what happens if the automatic countermeasures fail, and therefore if and how the driver can detect or block the attack, or manage its consequences. It is based on the 'human in the loop principles' and consists in testing the driver Situation Awareness in placing professional drivers and OCC operators (Operational Control Center) in a realistic simulator and playing scenarios involving attacks and observing their reactions. A preliminary methodology is proposed and discussed through concrete case studies. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Matrix completion has been rapidly grown interested in areas of engineering and applied science. however, most of applications are aim at single variate matrix. In fact, majority applications datasets express in form of multivariate matrix, developing multivariate matrix application is very necessary. The important is when the missing values too many, matrix completion of take advantage of active learning performance better than standard matrix completion. Although, several combining active learning for matrix completion solutions have been proposed, and most of them based on query strategy. But none of them emphasize the important location of matrix for recovering a matrix. In this paper, we design active multivariate matrix completion. The goal of this algorithm is that find a important location of matrix for matrix completion and combine rank aggregation to select query entries. Experiment evaluation base on images datasets. when we query a small amount of missing entries, the proposed active multivariate matrix completion efficiently raise the accuracy of matrix completion and give the important position of missing entries. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.},

abstract={State-of-the-art industrial control systems are complex implements featuring different spatial and temporal scales among components, multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, context-dependent and human-in-the-loop interaction patterns. Most control systems offer entry-points for malicious users to disrupt their functionality severely, which is unacceptable when they are part of the national critical infrastructure. Cyber-resilience, i.e., the ability of a system to sustain - possibly malicious - alterations while maintaining an acceptable functionality, is recognized as one of the keys to understand how much damage can be brought to a system and its surrounding environment in case of a successful cyber-attack. In this paper we compare methods to assess resilience considering both concrete simulation and symbolic simulation. Our ultimate goal is to provide maintainers and other stakeholders with a dynamic and quantitative measure of cyber-resilience. Here we present some results on a case study related to waste-water treatment, in order to provide initial evidence that concrete and symbolic simulation can be used in a complementary way to analyze the security of industrial control systems. © ECMS Lars Nolle, Alexandra Burger, Christoph Tholen, Jens Werner, Jens Wellhausen},

abstract={Due to the increasing need for effective security measures and the integration of cameras in commercial products, a huge amount of visual data is created today. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are inspecting images and videos to find radicalization, propaganda for terrorist organizations and illegal products on darknet markets. This is time consuming. Instead of an undirected search, LEAs would like to adapt to new crimes and threats, and focus only on data from specific locations, persons or objects, which requires flexible interpretation of image content. Visual concept detection with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a crucial component to understand the image content. This paper has five contributions. The first contribution allows image-based geo-localization to estimate the origin of an image. CNNs and geotagged images are used to create a model that determines the location of an image by its pixel values. The second contribution enables analysis of fine-grained concepts to distinguish sub-categories in a generic concept. The proposed method encompasses data acquisition and cleaning and concept hierarchies. The third contribution is the recognition of person attributes (e.g., glasses or moustache) to enable query by textual description for a person. The person-Attribute problem is treated as a specific sub-Task of concept classification. The fourth contribution is an intuitive image annotation tool based on active learning. Active learning allows users to define novel concepts flexibly and train CNNs with minimal annotation effort. The fifth contribution increases the flexibility for LEAs in the query definition by using query expansion. Query expansion maps user queries to known and detectable concepts. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the detectable concepts is required for the users. The methods are validated on data with varying locations (popular and non-Touristic locations), varying person attributes (CelebA dataset), and varying number of annotations. © 2018 SPIE.},

abstract={Despite many advances in deep-learning based semantic segmentation, performance drop due to distribution mismatch is often encountered in the real world. Recently, a few domain adaptation and active learning approaches have been proposed to mitigate the performance drop. However, very little attention has been made toward leveraging information in videos which are naturally captured in most camera systems. In this work, we propose to leverage “motion prior” in videos for improving human segmentation in a weakly-supervised active learning setting. By extracting motion information using optical flow in videos, we can extract candidate foreground motion segments (referred to as motion prior) potentially corresponding to human segments. We propose to learn a memory-network-based policy model to select strong candidate segments (referred to as strong motion prior) through reinforcement learning. The selected segments have high precision and are directly used to finetune the model. In a newly collected surveillance camera dataset and a publicly available UrbanStreet dataset, our proposed method improves the performance of human segmentation across multiple scenes and modalities (i.e., RGB to Infrared (IR)). Last but not least, our method is empirically complementary to existing domain adaptation approaches such that additional performance gain is achieved by combining our weakly-supervised active learning approach with domain adaptation approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={recently, researchers have devoted prominent machine learning-based anti-phishing models to survive a supreme cyber-security versus phishing evolution on the cyberspace. Yet, such models remain incompetent to detect new phish in a real-time application. In this concern, this paper advocates an empirical analysis with the recently published works via a chronological validation. Chronological validation achieved by testing the works on three benchmarking data sets to appraise the causality between their detection outcomes and their limitations. Throughout chronological validation, the tested works have fallen short at detecting new phish web pages with an accessible detection accuracy. High to moderate faults and misclassifications are resulted as implications for their limitations and fixed real-time settings. Accordingly, this paper infers that by elevating the tested models in terms of using new and hybrid features, robust subset of features, and actively learned classifiers; an adaptive anti-phishing model with adjustable settings will be resilient against the up-to-date and scalable web flows. With such inferences, this paper highlights what future trends to develop along with depicting a taxonomy of current status and open problems as a guide to the researchers for their future achievements. © 2017 IEEE.},

Effectiveness of these solutions relies on the amount of available annotated data which again depends on the generation of huge amount of accurately annotated data. In this paper, we focus on reducing the human annotation efforts with simultaneous increase in tracking accuracy to get precise, tight bounding boxes around an object of interest. We use a novel combination of two different tracking algorithms to track an object in the whole video sequence. We propose a sampling strategy to sample the most informative frame which is given for human annotation. This newly annotated frame is used to update the previous annotations. Thus, by collaborative efforts of both human and the system we obtain accurate annotations with minimal effort. Using the proposed method, user efforts can be reduced to half without compromising on the annotation accuracy. We have quantitatively and qualitatively validated the results on eight different datasets. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

Since these systems are used to administer graded assignments, and sometimes even exams, it is crucial to assess their security. Our work seeks to exploit and document potential vulnerabilities of clickers. For this purpose, we use software defined radios to perform jamming, sniffing and spoofing attacks on an audience response system in production, which provide different possible methods of cheating. The results of our study demonstrate that clickers are easily exploitable. We build a prototype and show that it is practically possible to covertly steal or forge answers of a peer or even an entire classroom, with high levels of confidence. Additionally, we find that the receivers software of the system lacks protection against unexpected answers, which allows our spoofer to submit any ASCII character and opens the receiver up to possible fuzzing attacks. As a result of this study, we discourage using clickers for high-stake assessments, unless they provide proper security protection. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving several technological trends. The first trend is an increased level of integration between edge devices and commodity computers. This trend, in conjunction with low power-devices, energy harvesting, and improved battery technology, is enabling the next generation of information technology (IT) innovation: city-scale smart systems. These types of IoT systems can operate at multiple time-scales, ranging from closed-loop control requiring strict real-time decision and actuation to near real-time operation with humans-in-the-loop, as well as to long-term analysis, planning, and decision-making. The second trend is an increased emphasis on resilient deployment platforms, which can be used to disperse computations closer to the physical phenomena. Two categories of these platforms can be distinguished based on the computing and communication resources they provide: (a) Edge platforms are low-power computing devices that are often available close to sensors and actuators, and (b) Cloudlet platforms are shared data centers that are managed locally, but can only provide a limited computing capacity. When these platforms are interconnected with a cloud or enterprise large-scale shared data center, they provide a unique opportunity for developing and deploying smart services [1]. While these platforms provide a key enabler for city-scale services, developing and operating these services becomes difficult due to the challenges associated with the remote, dynamic and distributed nature of these resources. This is especially difficult, considering that all critical services should remain available, even in vulnerable modes of operation, such as during faults, environmental changes, software updates, or cyber-attacks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber defense requires decision making under uncertainty, yet this critical area has not been a focus of research in judgment and decision-making. Future defense systems, which will rely on software-defined networks and may employ "moving target" defenses, will increasingly automate lower level detection and analysis, but will still require humans in the loop for higher level judgment. We studied the decision making process and outcomes of 17 experienced network defense professionals who worked through a set of realistic network defense scenarios. We manipulated gain versus loss framing in a cyber defense scenario, and found significant effects in one of two focal problems. Defenders that began with a network already in quarantine (gain framing) used a quarantine system more, as measured by cost, than those that did not (loss framing). We also found some difference in perceived workload and efficacy. Alternate explanations of these findings and implications for network defense are discussed.

abstract={In the age data digitalization, important applications of optics and photonics based sensors and technology lie in the field of biometrics and image processing. Protecting user data in a safe and secure way is an essential task in this area. However, traditional cryptographic protocols rely heavily on computer aided computation. Secure protocols which rely only on human interactions are usually simpler to understand. In many scenarios development of such protocols are also important for ease of implementation and deployment. Visual cryptography (VC) is an encryption technique on images (or text) in which decryption is done by human visual system. In this technique, an image is encrypted into number of pieces (known as shares). When the printed shares are physically superimposed together, the image can be decrypted with human vision. Modern digital watermarking technologies can be combined with VC for image copyright protection where the shares can be watermarks (small identification) embedded in the image. Similarly, VC can be used for improving security of biometric authentication. This paper presents about design and implementation of a practical laboratory experiment based on the concept of VC for a course in media engineering. Specifically, our contribution deals with integration of VC in different schemes for applications like digital watermarking and biometric authentication in the field of optics and photonics. We describe theoretical concepts and propose our infrastructure for the experiment. Finally, we will evaluate the learning outcome of the experiment, performed by the students. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={Safety culture is an essential requirement for nuclear industry. Nuclear engineering educational programs have a vital role in building, assessing, and evaluating the attainment of the attributes of this culture. For the time being, assessment in such programs is considered in the cognitive domain rather than the use of direct assessments techniques that are involved in the affective domain. In nuclear organizations, on the other hand, security and safety cutlers are measured mainly during practice by monitoring of the professionalism and the deviations from safe or secure environment. In the present work a project-based active cooperative learning course is designed to develop and measure the students' attainment of the attributes of safety culture. The key elements of the course depend mainly on assessing the confidentiality, transparency, best practices, and other elements of the cutlers through monitoring of the student's performance and attitudes in real open-ended problems. The assessment methodology relies mainly on behavior and attitude rather than gaining of the knowledge. The course methodology is not limited to nuclear academic programs but could be applied to other industrial training activities. © 2015 IEEE.},

This is an important but very challenging problem in intelligent surveillance video analysis areas. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet efficient framework KISSPOP to design a person re-identification system. In this system, we creatively combine the KISS metric (KISSME) learning with a human-in-the-loop one-shot negative sample mining process, which can also be regarded as a user feedback strategy. The purposes of feedback from user are two folds: 1. to optimize the initial result in the case KISSME does not perform well, which means the true match failed to be ranked into top n (e.g. 20); 2. to on-line update the KISSME model. Experiments on public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. © 2015 ACM.},

In this research, we evaluated a set of new curricular modules developed in the context of intelligence and security informatics (ISI). Our modules use an active learning pedagogy, business issues in the context of ISI, and realistic characters and stories to engage students in active learning of analytics concepts and skills. Findings from the study that compared two groups of students (control vs. treatment groups) show a statistically significant difference in students' average performance in homework assignments. Students who learned the subject using the new contextual curricular modules were found to achieve significantly higher average scores in homework assignments than students who learned the subject through the traditional method. The findings are very encouraging and show promise on using the new curricular modules in the teaching of foundation analytics courses. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The popularity of cloud computing along with the increased availability of cheap storage have led to the necessity of elaboration and transformation of large volumes of open-source data, all in parallel. One way to handle such extensive volumes of information properly is to take advantage of distributed computing frameworks like Map-Reduce. Unfortunately, an entirely automated approach that excludes human intervention is often unpredictable and error prone. Highly accurate data processing and decision-making can be achieved by supporting an automatic process through human collaboration, in a variety of environments such as warfare, cyber security and threat monitoring. Although this mutual participation seems easily exploitable, human-machine collaboration in the field of data analysis presents several challenges. First, due to the asynchronous nature of human intervention, it is necessary to verify that once a correction is made, all the necessary reprocessing is done in chain. Second, it is often needed to minimize the amount of reprocessing in order to optimize the usage of resources due to limited availability. In order to improve on these strict requirements, this paper introduces improvements to an innovative approach for human-machine collaboration in the processing of large amounts of open-source data in parallel. © 2015 SPIE.},

Real-life settings introduce many challenges that can impact the performance of real-time video analytics. Video analytics are desired to be resilient to adverse and changing scenarios. In this paper we present various approaches to characterize the uncertainty of a classifier and incorporate crowdsourcing at the times when the method is uncertain about making a particular decision. Incorporating crowdsourcing when a real-time video analytic method is uncertain about making a particular decision is known as online active learning from crowds. We evaluate our proposed approach by testing a method we developed previously for crowd flow estimation. We present three different approaches to characterize the uncertainty of the classifier in the automatic crowd flow estimation method and test them by introducing video quality degradations. Criteria to aggregate crowdsourcing results are also proposed and evaluated. An experimental evaluation is conducted using a publicly available dataset. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.},

abstract={In Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), especially in human-in-the-loop situations (also known as HitLCPS), the security and privacy for keeping sensitive information private is considered an emerging topic in recent decades. Many techniques in privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) can be applied directly to HitLCPS. However, most of them to date have focused on handling singular threshold problems for data sanitization. If a sensitive itemset includes more items, it has a higher probability of being identified due to its specificity. In this work, we propose a new concept of multiple support thresholds to assist in resolving this issue. The proposed method assigns a stricter threshold for an itemset. Furthermore, a genetic-algorithm (GA)-based model is involved in the designed algorithm to minimize side effects. In our experimental results, the GA-based PPDM approach is compared with traditional Greedy PPDM approaches. The strong experimental results clearly show that our proposed method can give similar performance to conventional algorithms while still maintaining higher-levels of security and privacy protection than previous methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This article investigates the energy operation problem based on We-Energy (WE), a novel full-duplex model in Energy Internet (EI). A dual-objective optimal energy operation model of WE is formulated with the consideration of economical benefit and security operation under different time scenarios. Due to the inaccurate model of distributed generation devices and loads, a multipolicy convex hull reinforcement learning (MCRL) algorithm is proposed. It can find the multiobjective strategy set with model-free feature. Moreover, considering the limitations of artificial intelligence technology and the human advantages in information processing for complex task, a two-channel Human-in-the-loop (HITL) method is designed to combine with MCRL to avoid decision-making risks. The one channel of HITL can evaluate the operation strategy by human under normal conditions so that the understanding of human for complex operating conditions can be incorporated into the machine learning algorithms to improve the confidence of intelligent systems. The other channel of HITL can allow human to participate in real-time adjustment under abnormal conditions to avoid system out of control. Simulation studies of modified EI are confirmed that the proposed algorithm can improve system performance effectively. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Despite decades of research in network traffic analysis and incredible advances in artificial intelligence, network intrusion detection systems based on machine learning (ML) have yet to prove their worth. One core obstacle is the existence of concept drift, an issue for all adversary-facing security systems. Additionally, specific challenges set intrusion detection apart from other ML-based security tasks, such as malware detection. In this work, we offer a new perspective on these challenges. We propose INSOMNIA, a semi-supervised intrusion detector which continuously updates the underlying ML model as network traffic characteristics are affected by concept drift. We use active learning to reduce latency in the model updates, label estimation to reduce labeling overhead, and apply explainable AI to better interpret how the model reacts to the shifting distribution. To evaluate INSOMNIA, we extend TESSERACT-a framework originally proposed for performing sound time-Aware evaluations of ML-based malware detectors-to the network intrusion domain. Our evaluation shows that accounting for drifting scenarios is vital for effective intrusion detection systems. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={In this study, we investigated a means to improve the robustness of deep network training on visual recognition tasks without sacrificing accuracy. The contribution of this work can reduce the dependence on model decay to gain a strong defense against malicious attacks, especially from adversarial samples. There are two major challenges in this study. First, the model defense capability should be strong and improved over the training stage. The other is that the degrading of the model performance must be minimized to ensure visual recognition performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose active dropblock (ActDB) by incorporating active learning into a dropblock. Dropblock effectively perturbs the feature maps, thus enhancing the invulnerability of gradient-based adversarial attacks. In addition, it selects an optimal perturbation solution to minimize the objective loss function, thereby reducing the model degradation. The proposed organic integration successfully solved the model robustness and accuracy simultaneously. We validated our approach using extensive experiments on various datasets. The results showed significant gains compared to state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Do iOS applications breach privacy? With plethora of iOS applications available in market, most users are unaware of security risks they pose. This includes breach of user's privacy by sharing personal and sensitive Smartphone data without user's consent. Apple follows strict code signing procedure to ensure that applications are developed from trusted enterprises. However, past malware attacks on iOS devices have demonstrated that there is lack of protection from permission misuse by applications. While machine learning approaches offer promising results in detecting such malicious applications for Android operating system, there has been minimal research in extending them to iOS platform due to unavailability of labeled data-sets. In this study, we propose iABC-AL (iOS Application analyzer and Behavior Classifier using Active Learning), a framework to detect malicious iOS applications. The objective of iABC-AL is to protect permission induced user's privacy risks by (i) maximizing precision of machine learning based classification models and (ii) minimize requirement of labeled training data-set. To attain the objective, iABC-AL framework incorporates category of application and active learning approaches. A total of 2325 iOS applications were evaluated. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy rate of 91.5% and increases precision of supervised approach by 14.5%. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Thus far, emergency calls are answered by human operators who interview the calling person in order to obtain all relevant information. In the near future—based on the Internet of (Medical) Things (IoT, IoMT)—accidents, emergencies, or adverse health events will be reported automatically by smart homes, smart vehicles, or smart wearables, without any human in the loop. Several parties are involved in this communication: the alerting system, the rescue service (responding system), and the emergency department in the hospital (curing system). In many countries, these parties use isolated information and communication technology (ICT) systems. Previously, the International Standard Accident Number (ISAN) has been proposed to securely link the data in these systems. In this work, we propose an ISAN-based communication platform that allows semantically interoperable information exchange. Our aims are threefold: (i) to enable data exchange between the isolated systems, (ii) to avoid data misinterpretation, and (iii) to integrate additional data sources. The suggested platform is composed of an alerting, responding, and curing system manager, a workflow manager, and a communication manager. First, the ICT systems of all parties in the early rescue chain register with their according system manager, which tracks the keep-alive. In case of emergency, the alerting system sends an ISAN to the platform. The responsible rescue services and hospitals are determined and interconnected for platform-based communication. Next to the conceptual design of the platform, we evaluate a proof-of-concept implementation according to (1) the registration, (2) channel establishment, (3) data encryption, (4) event alert, and (5) information exchange. Our concept meets the requirements for scalability, error handling, and information security. In the future, it will be used to implement a virtual accident registry. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Knowledge-based systems reason over some knowledge base. Hence, an important issue for such systems is how to acquire the knowledge needed for their inference. This paper assesses active learning methods for acquiring knowledge for “static code warnings”. Static code analysis is a widely-used method for detecting bugs and security vulnerabilities in software systems. As software becomes more complex, analysis tools also report lists of increasingly complex warnings that developers need to address on a daily basis. Such static code analysis tools are usually over-cautious; i.e. they often offer many warnings about spurious issues. Previous research work shows that about 35% to 91 % warnings reported as bugs by SA tools are actually unactionable (i.e., warnings that would not be acted on by developers because they are falsely suggested as bugs). Experienced developers know which errors are important and which can be safely ignored. How can we capture that experience? This paper reports on an incremental AI tool that watches humans reading false alarm reports. Using an incremental support vector machine mechanism, this AI tool can quickly learn to distinguish spurious false alarms from more serious matters that deserve further attention. In this work, nine open-source projects are employed to evaluate our proposed model on the features extracted by previous researchers and identify the actionable warnings in a priority order given by our algorithm. We observe that our model can identify over 90% of actionable warnings when our methods tell humans to ignore 70 to 80% of the warnings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Owing to the continuous barrage of cyber threats, there is a massive amount of cyber threat intelligence. However, a great deal of cyber threat intelligence come from textual sources. For analysis of cyber threat intelligence, many security analysts rely on cumbersome and time-consuming manual efforts. Cybersecurity knowledge graph plays a significant role in automatics analysis of cyber threat intelligence. As the foundation for constructing cybersecurity knowledge graph, named entity recognition (NER) is required for identifying critical threat-related elements from textual cyber threat intelligence. Recently, deep neural network-based models have attained very good results in NER. However, the performance of these models relies heavily on the amount of labeled data. Since labeled data in cybersecurity is scarce, in this paper, we propose an adversarial active learning framework to effectively select the informative samples for further annotation. In addition, leveraging the long short-term memory (LSTM) network and the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network, we propose a novel NER model by introducing a dynamic attention mechanism into the BiLSTM-LSTM encoderdecoder. With the selected informative samples annotated, the proposed NER model is retrained. As a result, the performance of the NER model is incrementally enhanced with low labeling cost. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={For these few decades malwares have been posing a major concern in the cyber security. Recently, a number of "author groups" have been generating lots of newmalwares by sharing source code within a group and exploiting evasive schemes such as polymorphism and metamorphism. This motivates us to study the problem of identifying the author group of a given malware, which would be able to work for not only blocking malwares but also legally punishing suspected malware authors. In this paper, we propose a human-machine collaborative approach for classifying author groups of malwares accurately. We also propose a visualization method for helping human experts to make the decision easily. We verify the superiority of our framework through extensive experiments using real-world malware data. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={The commitment and responsibility of new chemists is key for a world free of chemical weapons and illicit drugs, and for the development of ecofriendly technologies and a healthy environment. However, with a tight academic schedule for undergraduate and postgraduate students, it is difficult to find room for an appropriate discussion and debate about the dual use of the chemical sciences. Encouraged by the initiatives of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on education about the prevention of illicit purposes of chemistry, we have developed a one-day workshop, called the Itinerant Lecture, that covers theoretical aspects combined with activities to promote critical thinking among students. The main topics are presented in an engaging way that is open to discussion and includes activities such as fictional case analyses and role-playing, which allow students to consider the problematic aspects of their roles as scientists. This workshop has been running for the last 5 years, with apparently very high acceptance by students and teachers in the chemistry field. The use of videos, role-playing, and an active-learning strategy for the topics becomes an excellent approach to introduce chemistry students and teachers to concepts such as professional responsibility and dual use of knowledge in the sciences and their implications in the production of chemical weapons and other illegal uses.

abstract={Understanding access control policies is essential in understanding the security behavior of systems. However, often times, a complete and accurate specification of the enforced access control policy in a system is not available. In fact, scale and complexity of a system, or unavailability of its source code, may prevent users and even its developers from having access to such accurate specification. In this paper, we propose a novel, systematic approach for learning access control policies where target systems are treated as black boxes. In particular, we show how we can construct a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) characterizing the relationship-based access control (ReBAC) policy of a system by interacting with its access control engine using minimal number of access requests. Our experiments on realistic application scenarios and their promising results demonstrate the feasibility, scalability and efficiency of our learning approach. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={A key challenge for natural language based large text data is automatically extracting knowledge, in terms of entities and relations, embedded in it. State of the art relation extraction systems requires large amounts of labeled data, which is costly and very difficult, especially in industrial settings, due to time constraints of subject matter experts. Techniques like distant supervision require the availability of a related knowledge base, which is rarely possible. We have developed a novel model for automatically clustering textual Big Data, based on techniques inspired from Active Learning and Clustering, that can derive powerful insights and make the data ready for machine learning with minimal manual effort. Our approach differs from Active Learning as we operate under weak supervision, where all the instances provided for training are not manually labeled. Secondly, This differs from any prevailing clustering algorithms as we adopt a whole new approach of proximity clustering based on affinity propagation. Due to the extrapolation of the labeling efforts, our model makes it easier to adopt deep learning approaches with minimal manual effort. In this paper, we describe our algorithm in detail, along with the experimental results obtained for them. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Classifiers, e.g., those based on Naive Bayes, a support vector machine, or even a neural network, are highly susceptible to a data-poisoning attack. The attack objective is to degrade classification accuracy by covertly embedding malicious (labeled) samples into the training set. Such attacks can be mounted by an insider, through an outsourcing process (for data acquisition or training), or conceivably during active learning. In some cases, a very small amount of poisoning can result in dramatic reduction in classification accuracy. Data poisoning attacks are successful mainly because the malicious injected samples significantly skew the data distribution of the corrupted class. Such attack samples are generally data outliers and in principle separable from the clean samples. We propose a generalized, scalable, and dynamic data driven defense system that: 1) uses a mixture model both to well-fit the (potentially multi-modal) data and to give potential to isolate attack samples in a small subset of the mixture components; 2) performs hypothesis testing to decide both which components and which samples within those components are poisoned, with the identified poisoned ones purged from the training set. Our approaches addresses the attack scenario where adversarial samples are an unknown subset embedded in the initial training set, and can be used to perform data sanitization as a precursor to the training of any type of classifier. The promising results for experiments on the TREC05 spam corpus and Amazon reviews polarity dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense strategy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Requirements of human-machine systems change over long product lifecycles. Anticipating those changes during the initial design is challenging. Once deployed the changing requirements demands a systematic evaluation of the human-machine system, otherwise inefficiencies and accidents can happen. The interaction design concept Iteration by Design introduces a fifth design phase to the user-centred design process of the ISO 9241-210 norm to close the open evaluation loop of safety critical systems with long lifecycles. The implications of Iteration by Design are discussed in the context of resilience engineering. A higher order adaptation regulation loop copes with the complexity of the human-machine system interaction design. The resilience principles drift reaction and human in the loop are utilized to adapt the system to the changing requirements. A design assistance system is proposed to inform a design team about required changes. Finally, adaptive instructional training could be interwoven with the design assistance system to sustain the adaptability of the human-machine system. The value of Iteration by Design as an extension for user-centred design is illustrated by the accident of the USS John S. McCain from 2017. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={When introducing log management or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) practices, organizations are frequently challenged by Gartner's 3 Vs of Big Data: There is a large volume of data which is generated at a rapid velocity. These first two Vs can be effectively handled by current scale-out architectures. The third V is that of variety which affects log management efforts by the lack of a common mandatory format for log files. Essentially every component can log its events differently. The way it is logged can change with every software update. This paper describes the Log Analysis Machine Learner (LAMaLearner) system. It uses a blend of different Artificial Intelligence techniques to overcome variety issues and identify relevant events within log files. LAMaLearner is able to cluster events and generate human readable representations for all events within a cluster. A human being can annotate these clusters with specific labels. After these labels exist, LAMaLearner leverages machine learning based natural language processing techniques to label events even in changing log formats. Additionally, LAMaLearner is capable of identifying previously known named entities occurring anywhere within the logged event as well identifying frequently co-occurring variables in otherwise fixed log events. In order to stay up-to-date LAMaLearner includes a continuous feedback interface that facilitates active learning. In experiments with multiple differently formatted log files, LAMaLearner was capable of reducing the labeling effort by up to three orders of magnitude. Models trained on this labeled data achieved > 93% F1 in detecting relevant event classes. This way, LAMaLearner helps log management and SIEM operations in three ways: Firstly, it creates a quick overview about the content of previously unknown log files. Secondly, it can be used to massively reduce the required manual effort in log management and SIEM operations. Thirdly, it identifies commonly co-occurring values within logs which can be used to identify otherwise unknown aspects of large log files.

abstract={The paper examines the possibility and practical approach of combining the higher education standards in Ukraine and the best international practices in the training “Cybersecurity” specialists, since the process of transformation and formation of the world information society will gain momentum. The National Sustainable Development Strategy (see 3.1 “National Security and Defense Reform” [1]) for the period up to 2020 gives opportunity for a competitive global environment and the implementation of a number of innovations at the national level. It is impossible to handle these issues without assurance of having access to the modern infrastructure by all population sectors in order to effectively use it in practice. Essentially, the approach proposed in the CDIO standard, which creates conditions for active learning of technical students, is applied. The approach has been tested at two higher educational institutions of Ukraine (State University of Telecommunications and Borys Grinchenko Kyiv University) and described through of the program of the course “Wireless and Mobile Security.” The paper presents the results of master’s research. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Automated responses are a mechanism which can provide resilience in a power system by responding to anomalies. An automated response system can make intelligent decisions when paired with an automated health assessment system which includes a human in the loop for making critical decisions. Effective responses can be determined by developing a matrix which considers the likely impacts on resilience if a response is taken. A testbed assists to analyze these responses and determine their effects on system resilience. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We implement an efficient methodology for extracting themes from Securities Exchange Commission 13D filings using aspects of human-assisted active learning and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Sentences from the ‘Purpose of Transaction’ section of each filing are extracted and a randomly chosen subset is labelled based on six filing themes that the existing literature on shareholder activism has shown to have an impact on stock returns. We find that an LSTM neural network that accepts sentences as input performs significantly better, with precision of 77%, than an alternately specified neural network that uses the common bag of words approach. This indicates that both sentence structure and vocabulary are important in classifying SEC 13D filings. Our study has important implications, as it addresses the recent cautions raised in the literature that analysis of finance and accounting-related text sources should move beyond bag-of-words approaches to alternatives that incorporate the analysis of word sense and meaning reflecting context. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Classifiers are often used to detect malicious activities in adversarial environments. Sophisticated adversaries would attempt to find information about deployed classifiers in order to strategise different evasion techniques. It is a widely held belief that randomization of decision boundaries/rules of detection systems would introduce further complexities in attempts made by the adversaries for finding minimal adversarial cost (MAC) evading instances. We have extended the results obtained by Nelson et al. [14] and further presented a novel algorithm that can find optimal evading instances in randomized convex-inducing classifiers using polynomial-many queries. Our results have demonstrated that the complexity introduced through randomization only increases the complexity of finding an optimal evading instance by a constant factor and thus the risk of optimal evasion is still present. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={This Work-In-Progress Paper for the Innovative Practice Category presents a novel experiment in active learning of cybersecurity. We introduced a new workshop on hacking for an existing science-popularizing program at our university. The workshop participants, 28 teenagers, played a cybersecurity game designed for training undergraduates and professionals in penetration testing. Unlike in learning environments that are simplified for young learners, the game features a realistic virtual network infrastructure. This allows exploring security tools in an authentic scenario, which is complemented by a background story. Our research aim is to examine how young players approach using cybersecurity tools by interacting with the professional game. A preliminary analysis of the game session showed several challenges that the workshop participants faced. Nevertheless, they reported learning about security tools and exploits, and 61% of them reported wanting to learn more about cybersecurity after the workshop. Our results support the notion that young learners should be allowed more hands-on experience with security topics, both in formal education and informal extracurricular events. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={—Data discovery, linking and integration techniques are of great importance for big data variety challenge. Linked Open Data (LOD) and Semantic Web technologies have worked as a driver to address this challenge. However, until 2015, the linkage of triples of LOD has increased to 40%, of which only 3% of overall triples are links between different datasets. Today, with the increasing amount of available LOD datasets, 9671 datasets compose the LOD, the need to link them together is becoming vital. Links are usually generated, or discovered, by specific frameworks such as SILK and LIMES, which are two of the most effective tools in this domain. They apply instance matching rather than ontology matching, and support active learning. They both have their drawbacks and their advantages, which makes it hard to disregard one of them. This paper aims to evaluate whether SILK and LIMES are potential options for interlinking large-scale biomedical datasets, comparing the two frameworks at many levels, starting from the general features, reaching the comparison measures, the resulting files, the performance and the effectiveness of the links produced. The conclusions drawn from this work are to be used as a reference for the evaluation of the core differences between SILK and LIMES and therefore for choosing the most suitable tool in a Biomedical context. It can be considered as an opening for future research and enhancements of such frameworks. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Applications of drones have been rapidly changing during the last years. The driver in development of drone systems in the past was the military. This changed due to the fast technological progress of drone systems in the private sector as well as the industrial market. Sinking costs, progressive miniaturization, functional enlargement and increasing performance and usability are key enabler for practical realization of previously only theoretical civil and military exertions. RD is currently developing systems-of-systems, grouping drones into swarms to solve or execute mostly non-complex tasks cooperatively to demonstrate feasibility with respect to pre-defined scenarios. The used mission management and control systems are often rudimental, non-dynamic and designed to serve only the corresponding scenarios. For real world applications of drone systems operating in cooperative groups this is insufficient, as flexible control mechanisms with respect to changing environments or mission targets are missing. This work addresses mission management and control as the central executing and overarching system glue, rendering effective and efficient application of drone swarms possible in the first place. Requirements to the command and control station, the operator as human in the loop and the assigned assets are investigated and consolidated into a novel approach. The system centric view is neglected in favour of a paradigm shift to macro control by introducing the »management by objective» approach based on prior work. The focus of mission control by the operator is moved from system-oriented control to a goal-oriented control focusing on results provided by the executing assets. © 2019 SPIE.},

abstract={While the nation should maintain and expand the educational capabilities in cybersecurity given the current high demand for this sector, currently there exists a capacity issue: students cannot readily be added to the education system, especially at the Community Colleges level, because trained faculty to accommodate expanded academic demand are scarce. Cybersecurity experts in the workforce have the potential to fill the need for part-time cybersecurity faculty at the Community College level. The challenge is to prepare these technology-savvy individuals with classroom pedagogical insights and skills which not usually part of a cybersecurity experts skillset. A research question for this development project is “Can we use an online environment to provide pedagogy training for potential adjunct community college faculty.” Currently, the Reach To Teach project is exploring this possibility through a research effort engaging current faculty, as well as education experts, and a pilot Reach To Teach online course that is being made available to these cybersecurity experts. The Reach to Teach pilot is a set of six sessions, each of which includes the following: introduction to Community Colleges, ethics, and ideas for classroom pedagogy (e.g. the general structure of a course, crafting goals and objectives, techniques for moving explanations from the concreate to the abstract, using group work using case studies, and using discussions in classes). The team hosted a content review with community college educators and the pilot has been evaluated by 12 members of the target population. Their suggestions for improvement included. In addition to addressing these concerns, the revised pilot includes a modified interactive experience, Viewers are now able leave comments that can be read and replied to by course leaders or other individuals viewing the material.

abstract={Physical security systems (PSS) and humans are inescapably tied in the current physical security paradigm. Yet, physical security system evaluations often end at the console that displays information to the human. That is, these evaluations do not account for human-in-The-loop factors that can greatly impact performance of the security system, even though methods for doing so are well-established. This paper highlights two examples of methods for evaluating the human component of the current physical security system. One of these methods is qualitative, focusing on the information the human needs to adequately monitor alarms on a physical site. The other of these methods objectively measures the impact of false alarm rates on threat detection. These types of human-centric evaluations are often treated as unnecessary or not cost effective under the belief that human cognition is straightforward and errors can be either trained away or mitigated with technology. These assumptions are not always correct, are often surprising, and can often only be identified with objective assessments of human-system performance. Thus, taking the time to perform human element evaluations can identify unintuitive human-system weaknesses and can provide significant cost savings in the form of mitigating vulnerabilities and reducing costly system patches or retrofits to correct an issue after the system has been deployed. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The dynamically changing landscape of DDoS threats increases the demand for advanced security solutions. The rise of massive IoT botnets enables attackers to mount high-intensity short-duration 'volatile ephemeral' attack waves in quick succession. Therefore the standard human-in-the-loop security center paradigm is becoming obsolete. To battle the new breed of volatile DDoS threats, the intrusion detection system (IDS) needs to improve markedly, at least in reaction times and in automated response (mitigation). Designing such an IDS is a daunting task as network operators are traditionally reluctant to act - at any speed - on potentially false alarms. The primary challenge of a low reaction time detection system is maintaining a consistently low false alarm rate. This paper aims to show how a practical FPGA-based DDoS detection and mitigation system can successfully address this. Besides verifying the model and algorithms with real traffic 'in the wild', we validate the low false alarm ratio. Accordingly, we describe a methodology for determining the false alarm ratio for each involved threat type, then we categorize the causes of false detection, and provide our measurement results. As shown here, our methods can effectively mitigate the volatile ephemeral DDoS attacks, and accordingly are usable both in human out-of-loop and on-the-loop next-generation security solutions. © 2018 IFIP.},

abstract={Bringing together humans and machines in a performance-improving symbiosis requires giving our digital assistants, robots and other artificial teammates the ability to better understand the states of their human colleagues. In this paper, we discuss how technology can be used to assess human reactions to information, a critical technology development both for enabling the development of influence assessment tools, and for human-machine teaming. Developing technology suites to detect and exert influence is of paramount importance in a world where kinetic and non-kinetic effects interact to produce final outcomes in the national security domain. We discuss development of a comprehensive technology suite to allow the US and its Allies to detect and disrupt radicalization processes in multiple media; the suite is distinguished by its use of human-in-the-loop cognitive testing to allow rapid retailoring of information activity, and could give military personnel entirely new capabilities to understand and influence the information environment. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Secure automated threat detection and prevention is the more effective procedure to reduce the workload of analyst by scanning the network, server functions and then informs the analyst if any suspicious activity is detected in the network. It monitors the system continuously and responds according to the threat environment. This response action varies from phase to phase. Here suspicious activities are detected by the help of an artificial intelligence which acts as a virtual analyst concurrently with network intrusion detection system to defend from the threat environment and taking appropriate measures with the permission of the analyst. In its final phase where packet analysis is carried out to surf for attack vectors and then categorize supervised and unsupervised data. Where the unsupervised data will be decoded or converted to supervised data with help of analyst feedback and then auto-update the algorithm (virtual analyst). So that it evolves the algorithm (with active learning mechanism) itself by time and become more efficient, strong. So, it can able to defend form similar or same kind of attacks. © 2018 Authors.},

abstract={Technology-enhanced active learning (TEAL) spaces could represent a significant benefit to learning and teaching at universities. TEAL spaces support students in projecting presentations (e.g. from smart-phones) and sharing notes (e.g. from smart-watches) with peers. Importantly, this sharing is partly amongst their co-present small group but sometimes to the whole class. However, plugging personal things into smart spaces whose first requirement is to accept as many devices as possible is not without consequence. A projected notification of a political conversation, for example, has the potential to harm the individual both within the space and beyond, opening them to unwanted judgment, criticism and assessment. The traditional argument from the usable security community is that of intervention prior to any use whatever: users need to be trained, taught and/or nudged to avoid such problems. We conducted an informal focus group with students in a pilot TEAL space, exploring issues around the privacy and security of using personal devices in such spaces. The reality is that it is hard to perceive the privacy and security challenges prior to using the space. We argue that such prior interventions are not only a significant barrier to student adoption of smart spaces, but ineffective in ensuring the safety of individuals in the long-term. We argue that in designing smart spaces, both on-campus and off, designers need to adopt an approach of individually evolved privacy requirements to ensure an on-going safe, creative space for students. Two important features are: (a) as a small group develops bonds, its privacy level needs to be reduced over time and (b) the best privacy level depends on the whether the screen is currently shared with the small group or the large class. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Many real-life events have shown the detrimental outcomes of failing to account for humans in the loop. This research introduces a novel and cross-disciplinary methodology for modeling humans interacting with technologies to perform tasks within an SoS specifically within a layered physical security system use case. Metrics and formulations developed for this new way of looking at SoS termed sociotechnical SoS allow for the quantification of the interplay of effectiveness and efficiency seen in detection theory to measure the ability of a physical security system to detect and respond to threats. This methodology has been applied to a notional representation of a small military Forward Operating Base (FOB) as a proof-of-concept. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Software is now ubiquitous and software security is now realized as a growing threat. It is important for software developers to fix software security problems, however more imperative is for software developers to understand that security features are not to be introduced as patchwork when a security situation arises but are to be addressed and handled very early in the software development lifecycle. Industry's general lack of ignorance of software security benefits and more importantly the shortage of software practitioners possessing software security understanding creates multitude of problems in the software industry. Imparting real world experiences in the academia as well as the industry is a challenge due to lack of effective active learning tools (ALT). Riding on the success of developing and disseminating, 42 delivery hours of active learning tools in the area of software verification and validation the authors propose to partner with industry to develop 14 delivery hours of course modules developing ALTs in the form of class exercises, case studies, and case study videos and delivering them using a flipped classroom model. Through a gap analysis exercise jointly carried out with industry partners a draft requirements list has being identified. Specific exercises are being developed using an iterative development methodology. Student understanding is proposed to be assessed through quizzes, exams, assignment, and a learning survey. Once developed the ALTs will be made publicly available through a website. This paper discusses continuing work on the gap analysis in software security education, presents proposed contents areas for ALT, shares structures of three developed/proposed ALTs, presents a sample of a survey instrument, and presents a sample ALT on case study video. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.},

abstract={In order to protect the data in the smartphone, there is some protection mechanism that has been used. The current authentication uses PIN, password, and biometric-based method. These authentication methods are not sufficient due to convenience and security issue. Non-Intrusive authentication is more comfortable because it just collects user's behavior to authenticate the user to the smartphone. Several non-intrusive authentication mechanisms were proposed but they do not care about the training sample that has a long data collection time. This paper propose a method to collect data more efficient using Optimized Active Learning. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) used to identify the effect of some small amount of training data. This proposed system has two main functionalities, to reduce the training data using optimized stop rule and maintain the Error Rate using modified model analysis to determine the training data that fit for each user.Finally, after we done the experiment, we conclude that our proposed system is better than Threshold-based Active Learning. The time required to collect the data can reduced to 41% from 17 to 10 minutes with the same Error Rate. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

An apprentice/leader learning environment is created to sustain student involvement in ongoing projects. The evolution of the program is reviewed, including successes and challenges. We report on the demographics of students who have participated in the program so far, and on the success in attracting enthusiastic interest, notably among female students. The STEM Incubator program, like other similar programs described in this paper, attempts to put into practice the evidence-based teaching practices in active learning that have gained credence over the past decade.

abstract={With SESAR and NextGen readying towards implementing novel operational concepts and technical enablers in ATM/CNS, the question of how to manage security in a dynamic environment across a highly distributed and networked system gains higher attention. The Global ATM Security Management project (GAMMA) addresses the development of such a security situation management capability. Following the September 11 attacks and major large-scale outages of critical infrastructures, the security of air navigation has emerged as a critical capability gap. On-going transformation programs like SESAR and NextGen are moving into the deployment phase with limited to none tangible security solutions. GAMMA addresses this gap by investigating a security situation management capability. The framework of this capability is devised as a distributed network of aviation stakeholders that jointly collaborate in identifying and localizing security incidents while considering the constraints given by the different participants, national responsibilities, and collaboration-related requirements. This paper addresses the preparatory work for the validation of an initial security situation management capability. For that purpose, project partners setup a joint configuration and trial network for the security functions and systems developed in the frame of a real-time human-in-the-loop simulation. The simulation results have been measured against the mapping of the operational concept and validation requirements, in particular in terms of situational awareness on the operator side and networked incident management response. These results will inform the further validation activities of the project. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={System-of-systems modeling has traditionally focused on physical systems rather than humans, but recent events have proved the necessity of considering the human in the loop. As technology becomes more complex and layered security continues to increase in importance, capturing humans and their interactions with technologies within the system-of-systems will be increasingly necessary. After an extensive job-task analysis, a novel type of system-ofsystems simulation model has been created to capture the human-technology interactions on an extra-small forward operating base to better understand performance, key security drivers, and the robustness of the base. In addition to the model, an innovative framework for using detection theory to calculate d’ for individual elements of the layered security system, and for the entire security system as a whole, is under development. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The Japanese agricultural sector has been facing issues such as lack of successors and increase in elderly farmers in recent years. Finding ways to attract and offer learning opportunities for the young generation to become new farmers has become a serious concern. This study aims to clarify the role of the farmer as “educator or teacher”, the methods these farmers utilize to foster the motivation of the youth, and the significance of their impact. A series of farm visits at Shimosato Farm was conducted in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, life history interviews of selected learners were conducted in December 2013. This study focuses on Yoshinori Kaneko as a pioneer of organic farming (OF) since 1970 and farm stay since 1979, and his learners who did one-year farm stay in his Shimosato Farm in Ogawa Town, Saitama Prefecture. In response to lack of successors and increase in elderly farmers, he has been playing three (3) important roles. First, differing from institutions and schools, he has been able to spontaneously motivate and attract youths from non-farm households to do farm stay and has been accepting learners since 1979. Second, he has broadened the concept of OF from focusing solely on monetary gain to include its intrinsic value related to environmental conservation and food safety and security. Third, in recent years, he has been actively involved in institutions and colleges establishing or incorporating farm stays, organic agriculture curriculum and other active learning methods in their activities. In fact, he was one of the founders, and currently serves as a board member and lecturer at the Japan Institute of Agriculture Management. This study found that learners have engaged in ‘alternative’ farm stay for different reasons and duration. Among the 90 learners, more than 50% reported that they are currently engaged in farming. This conveys that farm stay seems to play a role in addressing the issue of lack of successors. In addition, the three selected learners showed distinctive and spontaneous action towards farm stay and OF, and in fostering the motivation of the next generation. Text-mining analysis and life history interviews revealed that learners considered the importance of connectedness (tsunagari), and mentor-companion relationship (shitei dogyo) remained strong, even after the farm stay since their ages happened to be near their mentors. © 2015 International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

abstract={The three-legged stool concept is widely used in gerontological and geriatric education as an explanation on how one should fiscally approach his or her retirement. Financial managers, planners, retirees, business owners, even the Social Security Administration uses this metaphor of fiscal soundness in retirement planning. Gerontologists are moving away from the “tripod of retirement income” and “three-legged stool” term, as more often market work is needed for financial security. This activity focuses on the tripod or three-legged stool concepts of retirement planning using active learning, allowing the students to work collaboratively in a group, reflect upon the activity, and most importantly have fun. The game also allows for an expansion of the tripod concepts into the four pillars of economic security, broaching the use of personal assets and the possible need for longer employment. Game scenarios also emphasize macro- and microlevel forces, such as race, gender, health status, education, or marital status, which can influence timing of retirement or the level of retirement income available. The authors include instructions on how to set up the learning experience including worksheets, as well as reflection questions posed throughout the process.

abstract={Software supply-chain attacks target components that are integrated into client applications. Such attacks often target widely-used components, with the attack taking place via operations (for example, file system or network accesses) that do not affect those aspects of component behavior that the client observes. We propose new active library learning and regeneration (ALR) techniques for inferring and regenerating the client-observable behavior of software components. Using increasingly sophisticated rounds of exploration, ALR generates inputs, provides these inputs to the component, and observes the resulting outputs to infer a model of the component's behavior as a program in a domain-specific language. We present Harp, an ALR system for string processing components. We apply Harp to successfully infer and regenerate string-processing components written in JavaScript and C/C++. Our results indicate that, in the majority of cases, Harp completes the regeneration in less than a minute, remains fully compatible with the original library, and delivers performance indistinguishable from the original library. We also demonstrate that Harp can eliminate vulnerabilities associated with libraries targeted in several highly visible security incidents, specifically event-stream, left-pad, and string-compare. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept adopted in nearly every aspect of human life, leading to an explosive utilization of intelligent devices. Notably, such solutions are especially integrated in the industrial sector, to allow the remote monitoring and control of critical infrastructure. Such global integration of IoT solutions has led to an expanded attack surface against IoT-enabled infrastructures. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated their ability to resolve issues that would have been impossible or difficult to address otherwise; thus, such solutions are closely associated with securing IoT. Classical collaborative and distributed machine learning approaches are known to compromise sensitive information. In our paper, we demonstrate the creation of a network flow-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aiming to protecting critical infrastructures, stemming from the pairing of two machine learning techniques, namely, federated learning and active learning. The former is utilized for privately training models in federation, while the latter is a semi-supervised approach applied for global model adaptation to each of the participant’s traffic. Experimental results indicate that global models perform significantly better for each participant, when locally personalized with just a few active learning queries. Specifically, we demonstrate how the accuracy increase can reach 7.07% in only 10 queries. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={As a widely deployed security scheme, text-based completely automated public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHAs) have become increasingly unable to resist machine learning-based attacks. So far, many researchers have conducted studies on approaches for attacking text-based CAPTCHAs deployed by different companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple, and achieved specific results. However, most of these attacks have shortcomings, such as the poor portability of attack methods, which require a series of data preprocessing steps and rely on large amounts of labeled CAPTCHAs. In this study, we propose an efficient and simple end-to-end attack method based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (Cycle-GANs). Compared to previous studies, our approach significantly reduces the cost of data labeling. Additionally, this method has high portability. It can attack ordinary text-based CAPTCHA schemes only by modifying a few configuration parameters, which makes the attack easier to execute. First, we train CAPTCHA synthesizers based on the Cycle-GAN to generate some fake samples. Basic recognizers based on a convolutional recurrent neural network are trained using the fake data. Subsequently, an active transfer learning method is employed to optimize the basic recognizer utilizing tiny amounts of labeled real-world CAPTCHA samples. Our approach efficiently cracked the CAPTCHA schemes deployed by 10 popular websites, indicating that our attack method may be universal. Additionally, we analyzed the current most popular anti-recognition mechanisms. The results show that the combination of more anti-recognition mechanisms can improve the security of CAPTCHAs. However, the improvement is limited. Conversely, generating more complex CAPTCHAs may cost more resources and reduce the usability of CAPTCHAs. © 2020},

abstract={Purpose: Algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), machines, and all emerging digital technologies disrupt traditional auditing, raising many questions and debates. One of the central issues of this debate is the human-algorithms complex duality, which focuses on this investigation. This study aims to investigate the algorithms’ penetration in auditing activities, with a specific focus of a future scenario on the human-algorithms interaction in performing audits as intelligent teams. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a qualitative reflexive thematic analysis, taking into consideration the academic literature, as well as professional reports and websites of the “Big Four” audit firms and internationally recognized accounting bodies. Findings: The results debate the complex duality between algorithms and human-based actions in the institutional settings of auditing activities by highlighting the actual stage of algorithms, machines and AI emergence in audit and providing real-life examples of their use in the audit. Furthermore, they emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms compared to human beings. Based on the results, a discussion on the human-algorithms interaction from the lens of the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach concludes that the Auditor-Governing-the-Loop may be a possible scenario for the future of the auditing profession. Research limitations/implications: This study is exploratory, investigating academia and practitioners’ written debates, analyzes and reports, limiting its applicability. Nonetheless, the paper adds to the ongoing discussion on emerging technologies and auditing research. Finally, the authors address some potential biases associated with the extended use of algorithms and discuss future research implications. Future research should empirically test how the human-algorithms tandem is working and how AI and other emerging technologies will affect auditing activities and the auditing profession. Practical implications: The study provides valuable insights for audit firms, auditors, professional organizations and standard-setters, and regulators revealing the implication of algorithms’ penetration in auditing activities from the human-algorithms complex duality perspective. Moreover, the academic education and research implications are highlighted, in terms of updating the educational curriculum by including the new technologies issues, as well as the need for further research investigations concerning the human-algorithms interactions issues as, for example, trust, legal restrictions, ethical concerns, security and responsibility. Originality/value: The research uses HITL as a novel paradigm for responsible AI development in auditing. The study points to the strategic value of a HITL pattern for organizational reflexivity that, according to the study, ensures that the algorithm’s output meets the audit organization’s requirements and changes in the environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social networking and micro-blogging services, such as Twitter, play an important role in sharing digital information. Despite the popularity and usefulness of social media, they are regularly abused by corrupt users. One of these nefarious activities is so-called fake news - a virus that has been spreading rapidly thanks to the hospitable environment provided by social media platforms. The extensive spread of fake news is now becoming a major problem with far-reaching negative repercussions on both individuals and society. Hence, the identification of fake news on social media is a problem of utmost importance that has attracted the interest not only of the research community but most of the big players on both sides - such as Facebook, on the industry side, and political parties on the societal one. In this work, we create a model through which we hope to be able to offer a solution that will instill trust in social network communities. Our model analyses the behaviour of 50, 000 politicians on Twitter and assigns an influence score for each evaluated user based on several collected and analysed features and attributes. Next, we classify political Twitter users as either trustworthy or untrustworthy using random forest and support vector machine classifiers. An active learning model has been used to classify any unlabeled ambiguous records from our dataset. Finally, to measure the performance of the proposed model, we used accuracy as the main evaluation metric. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Data exfiltration is a serious threat to organizations. Such exfiltrations cause breach events that can lead to millions of dollars of loss. Perimeter defense is not enough by itself since successful exploits from insiders can also be very damaging. Internal network user activities need to be monitored to detect malicious actions. Automatic machine learning methods can be applied for network anomaly detection, but they create a lot of false alarms. Domain experts can identify malicious users, but they are unable to process large volumes of data. Interactive machine learning (iML) deals with this tradeoff by creating an efficient collaboration between domain experts and machine learning algorithms. Previous research in iML has focused mainly on collaboration with non-experts. The design and requirements for expertise-driven iML have yet to be delineated for cybersecurity applications. In this research, we proposed an Active Learning (AL) model trained with outputs from a liberal (outputting many false alarms as well as possible hits) anomaly detection (AD) criterion to study expert-iML collaboration in anomaly detection. The results showed that: iML in this context can prune false alarms and minimize misses; the performance/compatibility tradeoff that typically occurs in conventional machine learning updates may be less salient in iML. We suggest that compatibility between experts and algorithms can be improved by presenting information about feature relevance during the training process. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={As the healthcare industries move into the digitalization of health records, blockchain application could be a significant game-changer in the healthcare sector, creating a secure and flexible ecosystem for the exchange of records. Making healthcare clearer by creating a blockchain system to eliminate fraud and improve data accuracy is vital. Blockchain can securely interoperable record data such as organs, blood, critical drugs, and keeping medical licenses and certificates. With the emergence of Bitcoin, the first popular blockchain decentralized application, blockchain has become a viable solution for recording transactions in a growing list called blocks which are linked and protected using cryptography. However, with the ever-increasing demand for blockchain professionals and developers, there are few hands-on labs/modules available for training current students, the future developer professionals. The objective is to develop a framework including a series of hands-on labs that would fit individual student's needs for blockchain in public health. This framework will help students to find their current level and propose an appropriate level of the hands-on lab for developing blockchain decentralized - applications in public health. This approach will help students to learn and comprehend the fundamental blockchain concepts systematically. A set of hands-on labs would be built based on real-life scenarios, to enhance their ability to understand and solve real-life cybersecurity problems in healthcare. This integrated approach would expose the students to the cost to risk involved at each stage of the blockchain application for electronic health records. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Malicious attacks in the network should be detected and examined by exploring its type, intension, nature, cause, and effects to handle security threats. The attack could be just for an acquaintance or with determination to harm a network. The type of attack implemented is black hole in which the traffic is attracted by node and destination is kept deprived of the transmission. The analysis is done using FTP, VBR, and CBR generators at the application layer. VBR is supported by IPv4 only. The scenario is designed using IPv4 over DYMO routing protocol as it is an advanced version of AODV for the traffic generators that supports IPv4. The traffic monitoring protocols are applied to check the packet delivery rate at the sink and in case of any possibility of leakage, the traffic is directed through some other shortest path with the assumption of availability of malicious node which needs to be eliminated from transmission as a preventive measure. Black hole usually assimilates traffic of the network around it and tries to harm the network by reducing the performance metrics of the system. The aim is to enhance different characteristics for diverting the traffics toward a black-hole node in the initial scenario, later on detecting a malicious node, preventive steps are applied, viz the node is taken in a loop of suspension and is deactivated from transmission by using a phenomenon called Human-in-the-loop. To measure performance metrics like utilization, average transmission delay, end-to-end delay, traffic analysis, and packet delivery rate are used. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel tandem human-machine cognition approach for human-in-the-loop control of complex business-critical and mission-critical systems and processes that are monitored by Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor networks and where it is of utmost importance to mitigate and avoid cognitive overload situations for the human operators. We present an advanced pattern recognition system, called the Multivariate State Estimation Technique-2, which possesses functional requirements designed to minimize the possibility of cognitive overload for human operators. These functional requirements include: (1) ultralow false alarm probabilities for all monitored transducers, components, machines, subsystems, and processes; (2) fastest mathematically possible decisions regarding the incipience or onset of anomalies in noisy process metrics; and (3) the ability to unambiguously differentiate between sensor degradation events and degradation in the systems/processes under surveillance. The prognostic machine learning innovation presented herein does not replace the role of the human in operation of complex engineering systems, but augments that role in a manner that minimizes cognitive overload by very rapidly processing, interpreting, and displaying final diagnostic and prognostic information to the human operator in a prioritized format that is readily perceived and comprehended. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Deep learning has undergone tremendous advancements in computer vision studies. The training of deep learning neural networks depends on a considerable amount of ground truth datasets. However, labeling ground truth data is a labor-intensive task, particularly for large-volume video analytics applications such as video surveillance and vehicles detection for autonomous driving. This paper presents a rapid and accurate method for associative searching in big image data obtained from security monitoring systems. We developed a semi-automatic moving object annotation method for improving deep learning models. The proposed method comprises three stages, namely automatic foreground object extraction, object annotation in subsequent video frames, and dataset construction using human-in-the-loop quick selection. Furthermore, the proposed method expedites dataset collection and ground truth annotation processes. In contrast to data augmentation and data generative models, the proposed method produces a large amount of real data, which may facilitate training results and avoid adverse effects engendered by artifactual data. We applied the constructed annotation dataset to train a deep learning you-only-look-once (YOLO) model to perform vehicle detection on street intersection surveillance videos. Experimental results demonstrated that the accurate detection performance was improved from a mean average precision (mAP) of 83.99 to 88.03. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Palmprint recognition allows accurate identity verification to build a security system. Recently, researchers introduce deep learning to this area that largely improves the recognition accuracy. However, as a supervised approach, its performance relies on availability of data and labels for every registered identity. For large-scale security systems, after image acquisition, we need to check the whole dataset and manually assign labels through comparison, which is a time-consuming task. Besides, labelling some redundant training samples contributes little to the recognition result. In this paper, we introduce an active learning framework to select the best sample set for label assignment. We regard the active learning as a binary classification task and attempt to make the labeled and unlabeled set indistinguishable. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate our model can reduce the annotation cost while achieving comparable recognition performance. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We in this paper explore a new link prediction paradigm, called ‘worship’ prediction, to discover worship links between users and celebrities on social networks. The prediction of ‘worship’ links enables valuable social services, such as viral marketing, popularity estimation, and celebrity recommendation. However, as the concern of business security and personal privacy, only public-accessible statistical social properties, instead of the detailed information of users, can be utilized to predict the ‘worship’ labels. In addition, we observe that friendship properties are not effective to predict the desired links, meaning that most of previous work which rely on the friendship properties cannot be successfully applied in the prediction of worship link. To address these issues, a novel learning framework is devised, including a factor graph with new discovered statistical properties and a Gaussian estimation based learning algorithm with active learning. Our experimental studies on real data, including Instagram, Twitter and DBLP, show that the proposed learning framework can overcome the problem of missing labels and efficiently discover worship links. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In Japan, the ratio and the number of elder driver have increased following with the number of traffic accidents which has become a social problem. The problem can easily be solved only if the elders does not need to drive by themselves, although, elders living in the country side or suburban areas still needs to drive for daily activities. Thus, supporting the mobility for the elders and preventing traffic accidents at the same time is very important. Self-driving cars are considered to become one of the solutions to solve this issue, though it is still one of the state-of-art technology still under challenging research. Therefore, this paper proposes a practical approach to test functions and interfaces of the self-driving car for elder drivers. In particular, this paper features use of an immersive virtual reality environment for a human-in-the-loop simulation test. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Adversary sophistication in the cyber domain is a constantly growing threat. As more systems become accessible from the Internet, the risk of breach, exploitation, and malice grows. To thwart reconnaissance and exploitation, Moving Target Defense (MTD) has been researched and deployed in various systems to modify the threat surface of a system. Tools are necessary to analyze the security, reliability, and resilience of their information systems against cyber-Attack and measure the effectiveness of the MTD technologies. Today's security analyses utilize (1) real systems such as computers, network routers, and other network equipment; (2) computer emulations (e.g., virtual machines); and (3) simulation models separately. In this paper, we describe the progress made in developing and utilizing hybrid Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) environments for the evaluation of a set of MTD technologies. The LVC methodology has been most rooted in the Modeling Simulation (MS) work of the Department of Defense. With the recent advances in virtualization and software-defined networking, Sandia has taken the blueprint for LVC and extended it by crafting hybrid environments of simulation, emulation, and human-in-The-loop. Furthermore, we discuss the empirical analysis of MTD technologies and approaches with LVC-based experimentation, incorporating aspects that may impact an operational deployment of the MTD under evaluation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={To counter the continuous threat posed by Android malware, we attempted to devise a novel method based on active learning. Nonetheless, evaluating our active learning based method on three different Android malware datasets resulted in performance discrepancies. In an attempt to explain such inconsistencies, we postulated research questions and designed corresponding experiments to answer them. The results of our experiments unveiled the reasons behind the struggles of our method and, more importantly, revealed some limitations with the current Android malware detection methods that, we fear, can be leveraged by malware authors to evade detection. In this paper, we share with the research community our research questions, experiments, and findings to instigate researchers to devise methods to tackle such limitations. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The smart grid is expected to self-heal, self-optimize, self-configure, and self-protect from physical and cyber- disturbances. These requirements are expected to be built into autonomous controllers as intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) that control power distribution buses. The functionality of these IEDs are redistributing electric loads across power generation sources, controlling voltage and amperages in order to stabilize frequencies, satisfy economic objectives and address physical and cyber-attacks. The current power grid has a centralized communication system with a centralized human-in-the- loop controller in order to adjust operating configurations of equipment within a power distribution zone. Implementing autonomous functions by moving from a centralized control architecture to a decentralized architecture can empower local controllers with greater control over local equipment and operations. We present the secure overlay communication model (SOCOM) for smart microgrids (μGrid) as a solution to decentralizing the traditional centralized control architecture and a decentralized communication platform for peer bus controllers to operate the grid. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Along with the rapid development of hardware security techniques, the revolutionary growth of countermeasures or attacking methods developed by intelligent and adaptive adversaries have significantly complicated the ability to create secure hardware systems. Thus, there is a critical need to (re)evaluate existing or new hardware security techniques against these state-of-the-art attacking methods. With this in mind, this paper presents a novel framework for incorporating active learning techniques into hardware security field. We demonstrate that active learning can significantly improve the learning efficiency of physical unclonable function (PUF) modeling attack, which samples the least confident and the most informative challenge-response pair (CRP) for training in each iteration. For example, our experimental results show that in order to obtain a prediction error below 4%, 2790 CRPs are required in passive learning, while only 811 CRPs are required in active learning. The sampling strategies and detailed applications of PUF modeling attack under various environmental conditions are also discussed. When the environment is very noisy, active learning may sample a large number of mislabeled CRPs and hence result in high prediction error. We present two methods to mitigate the contradiction between informative and noisy CRPs. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Wind power prediction is very important to guarantee security and stability of the wind farm and power system operation, and wind speed forecasting is the key to wind power prediction. Due to dramatic changes and shorter collection intervals in wind speed, it generates a larger numbers of samples, which affects modeling time and accuracy. Therefore, a short-term wind speed prediction method based on active learning with sample selection is proposed. The main objective of active learning is to collect training samples by minimizing the error of the prediction process while minimizing the number of training samples used. First the initial training set is selected, then selecting the sample with higher Euclidean distance adding to the training set and delete the samples with lower cross-validation error. Finally, the establishment of support vector machine model and neural network model to predict the results of comparison. Taking a wind farm in Jiangsu Province as the actual experimental data, simulation results show that this method can ensure the prediction accuracy, while effectively reducing the number of training samples. © 2017 IEEE.},

Model observers (MO) which mimic the human visual system can help to support the HO during this reading process or can provide feedback to the MR scanner and/or HO about the derived image quality. For this purpose MOs are trained on HO-derived image labels with respect to a certain diagnostic task. We propose a non-reference image quality assessment system based on a machine-learning approach with a deep neural network and active learning to keep the amount of needed labeled training data small. A labeling platform is developed as a web application with accounted data security and confidentiality to facilitate the HO labeling procedure. The platform is made publicly available. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Today's devices, which make up the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), are becoming increasingly more heterogeneous, mobile and intelligent. They represent an untapped computational resource that is available on site. By taking advantage of these devices we reduce the need for distant service providers: direct communication with neighbour devices becomes key for handling local tasks and information. Thus, the traditional cloud is 'descending' to the network edge and becoming 'diffused' among the client devices in both mobile and wired networks. Since single individuals are now becoming walking sensor networks, with many types of devices (smart-shirts, smartphones, smart glasses, smart watches...), human behavior begins to have a significant impact on the availability of resources. This means that security risks rise tremendously in these distributed clouds.The objective of this paper is to present an analysis of security in the future Internet - an Internet that integrates the concepts of Fog of Things (FoT) and Human in the Loop (HiTL).

abstract={Classifying unknown malicious binaries into malware families provides valuable information to security professionals. The task of recognizing a malicious binary (i.e., atributing it to a previously observed atack patern) is widely considered a difficult task requiring extensive domain expertise. In this work, we offer a new approach which focuses on transforming the the recognition problem domain from system traces to Chernoff faces, thereby engaging the facial recognition aptitude of laymen. To do so we (i) curated a expert tagged dataset of malware variants, (ii) instrumented behavior trace monitors for each variant, (iii) constructed a simple, graph based feature set from the runtime behavior, and (iv) visualized low-dimensional representations of these system call graphs with stick figures and Chernoff faces. We then selected the three families with the largest variation and asked non-experts on Amazon Mechanical Turk to classify binaries between these three families using the generated visual representations, a task that would otherwise be delegated to experts. We found that non-experts completed the task with between 63% and 86% accuracy, and when aggregated, these non-expert labels successfully trained a classifier to a similar level of performance as the ground truth labels. Although simple, the experiments conducted provide a novel evaluation of the inherent difficulty of malware recognition tasks. Additionally new operational possibilities for effective human in the loop malware recognition are indicated and discussed as future work within the research prospectus. Copyright © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Designing efficient operational procedures and training operators to be responsive and consistent with them in a timely manner is critical in many industrial sectors. Indeed, companies strive to achieve increased efficiency in the procedure design process and look for innovative valuable and cost-effective approaches that push operators to reach the plateau of such procedures' learning curve as quickly as possible in order to save money and time. In particular, port terminals, and car terminals specifically, are complex systems because many operations involving coordination problems usually take place. In car terminals, complex procedures must be strictly respected and are regulated by security, reliability, optimisation and synchronisation protocols that each worker has to know and comply with when performing his tasks. Therefore, a consistent and replicable simulation-based framework is proposed for training operators in car terminals in order to improve operator's efficiency and enhance the effectiveness of both training activities and procedure design processes. Cutting-edge technologies are integrated with the proposed system, thus providing the end-user with a full-immersive experience and promoting a human-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop approach.

The contributions of this tool on promoting engineering students' learning of embedded system designs and security are also investigated. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The iris is a stable biometric that has been widely used for human recognition in various applications. However, official deployment of the iris in forensics has not been reported. One of the main reasons is that the current iris recognition techniques in hard to visually inspect by examiners. To further promote the maturity of iris recognition in forensics, one way is to make the similarity between irises visualizable and interpretable. Recently, a humanin- the-loop iris recognition system was developed, based on detecting and matching iris crypts. Building on this framework, we propose a new approach for detecting and matching iris crypts automatically. Our detection method is able to capture iris crypts of various sizes. Our matching scheme is designed to handle potential topological changes in the detection of the same crypt in different acquisitions. Our approach outperforms the known visible feature based iris recognition method on two different datasets, by over 19% higher rank one hit rate in identification and over 46% lower equal error rate in verification. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Connected medicine, using smart (software based and networked) medical devices is frequently presented as the major disruptive trend in health care. Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are "prescribed" by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort / various patient groups with various preferences / multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security & privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.) / multiple variants (operating modes, device settings) / variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into "actionable knowledge", especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied. The goal of this paper is to present the complexity of the problem, warn against hasty, purely technical solutions, raise interest among specialists in health statistics and ignite an interdisciplinary cooperation to solve it. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Tools that automate testing of web applications for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities perform well when they have a strong knowledge base. Though, they heavily rely on brute force, which is not always an effective choice. On the other hand, expert penetration testers adopt exploit methods that are more accurate, but often not structured. We propose to solve the above mentioned problems, by designing and implementing an intelligent agent, called Suggester, that recommends actions to penetration testers. First, a black-box testing methodology inspired by a penetration tester's behavior, is developed. Such methodology consists of sending a sequence of strings to a web application and observing the responses. Then, an agent is trained to produce attack strings using the framework of a Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning environment (MORL), with a parameterized action space. Each complete attack string is identified as a separate objective to reach. Q-Learning is used to train the agent upon separate, unrelated objectives. Then, the learned actions are suggested to a human-in-the-loop, who performs the actions and collects observations. This allows to orchestrate the agent into pursuing the right objective and selecting the next best action to recommend. The final evaluation proves the scalability of the proposed solution, as well as show an increase in accuracy when compared to other automated scanners. © 2021},

We provide a framework for measuring skills demonstrated by students within an active learning setting where the primary focus is on practical expertise. We also examine several unique aspects of designing such a gamified framework (e.g. the game itself must be insecure enough to be "hackable", but secure enough not to be abused), and discuss how the framework was used to expose students to various security concepts. We found that our gamified experience heavily engaged students. We also encountered many pain points during our intervention and discovered a number of important aspects of gamified settings that must be carefully considered. For one, the goals of a semi-structured gamified exercise can sometimes lead to learners discovering solutions that do not meet the desired learning objectives. Furthermore, The exploratory nature of such exercises can also lead learners down a rabbit hole that, without a proper "safety net", they may not exit. Finally, complex tasks modeled after real world applications can leave little room for error, frustrating students and limiting instructors' ability to accurately assess different levels of skill. Based on our experience designing this intervention, we provide a number of transferable recommendations. The challenges we faced and the lessons we learned can be invaluable to those considering gamification as a cybersecurity education strategy. © 2021 ACM.},

A theorem by Khoury and Hadfield-Menell (KH), provides sufficient conditions to guarantee the robustness of active learning algorithms, but comes with a caveat: it is crucial to know the smallest distance among the classes of the corresponding classification problem. We propose a theoretical framework that allows us to think of active learning as sampling the most promising new points to be classified, so that the minimum distance between classes can be found and the theorem KH used. Additionally, we introduce a quantum active learning algorithm that makes use of such framework and whose complexity is polylogarithmic in the dimension of the space, m, and the size of the initial training data n, provided the use of qRAMs; and polynomial in the precision, achieving an exponential speedup over the equivalent classical algorithm in n and m. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={The ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) can cause devastating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In order to thwart IoT-enabled DDoS attacks, network operators can deploy an anomaly detection system that detects and mitigates the DDoS traffic near the source of the attack. Unfortunately, anomaly detection systems face conflicting real-world deployment challenges in IoT networks. Namely, many IoT network operators cannot deploy systems that require manual parameter tuning or labeling, but without such system maintenance, previously proposed anomaly detection systems display far too many false positives for acceptable deployment in IoT networks. To exacerbate this problem, pre-trained machine learning models often fail to accurately classify traffic when ported to a new environment (i.e., domain shift), and must either retrain with labeled data painstakingly collected from the newly deployed network or exhibit poor accuracy.In order to overcome these IoT deployment challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection system, Rapid, that successfully detects IoT-enabled DDoS attacks but also meets the accuracy demands of IoT under domain shift with little to no system maintenance from IoT network operators. Rapid initially provides robust detection through advanced machine learning techniques such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), but further, Rapid introduces a novel active learning technique that interweaves closely with attack mitigation to automatically adapt to new network domains without manual system maintenance. Rapid operates in real-time, and even though we leverage neural network techniques that typically cannot explain their predictions, our system architecture can provide diagnostic insight into any detected attack. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={During the last years, computers have changed the way people live and work. There is no field in which computers do not play a very important role. Education also has grown beyond learning from textbooks. Computer-Based Education refers to teaching methodologies using computers as a key component of information transmission. The paper presents different computer-based tools applied in the course "Telecommunication Security", included as compulsory in the curriculum of the specialty "Internet and Mobile Communications" for Bachelors at the University of Ruse but it can be applied in other courses covering topics of cryptography and information protection. During the classes students develop an application in MS Excel illustrating the principle of operation of a cryptosystem based on non-linear feedback shift registers generating de Bruijn Sequence, built on the basis of a 3-bit shift register and additional logic gates. Then the students implement the device studied using Logisim, an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits and they can see the operation of the real device. The paper describes MS EXCEL-based applications implementing and graphically illustrating the processes of encryption and decryption of words in English using cryptosystems based on non-linear feedback shift registers (NLFSRs) generating de Bruijn Sequence. Numerous examples obtained by the applications are presented in the paper. Details about the functions used for the implementation are given. Some problems that arise when encrypting and decrypting texts are illustrated by examples. The application helps the teacher in the process of generating individual assignments for the students and facilitates the lecturer in checking the students' works. In groups with a higher number of students, the application might be used by students to check their works or the works of their colleagues. The topic could be presented in an accessible manner for pupils in the schools, without using the terminology required for students with the aim to attract future students to our university. Using active learning during the classes in the course, the lecturer understands the students who learnt the new lesson and the students who did not. Student self-assessment implicates students in evaluating their own work and learning progress. Using self-assessment, students can identify their own skill gaps and see where to focus their attention in learning, revise their work and track their own progress. This process helps students stay involved and motivated and encourages self-reflection and responsibility for their learning. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

abstract={Intrusion detection plays a very important role in the field of network security. In order to improve the intrusion detection rate, intrusion detection algorithms based traditional machine learning are widely used in this field. These methods generally satisfy the following two assumptions: the training and the testing data must be under the condition of the independent and identical distribution; the training samples are sufficient. However, in practice, the above assumptions are difficult to satisfy, which will result in poor intrusion detection. This paper proposes an intrusion detection algorithm based on active transfer learning ACTrAdaBoost. ACTrAdaBoost takes advantage of transfer learning and need not to satisfy the two assumptions of the traditional machine learning. In addition, ACTrAdaBoost utilizes active learning and maximum mean discrepancy knowledge to obtain maximum knowledge with minimum training sample cost and solve the problem of negative transfer. The ACTrAdaBoost compared with the traditional machine learning method on the KDDCUP99, DARPA1998 and ISCX2012 datasets. The experimental results show that the intrusion detection rate of the ACTrAdaBoost algorithm is greater than benchmark algorithms, and the training time efficiency improves at the same time. The performance of ACTrAdaBoost is better than the traditional machine learning classification algorithm. The ACTrAdaBoost algorithm improves the accuracy of intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe faculty and graduate students’ motivation and learning experiences in a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary graduate course focused on the nexus of food and nutritional security, hunger, and sustainability. Design/Methodology/Approach: A one-group pre-experimental case study design was used. Faculty and students completed questionnaires, which included rating scales and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed and triangulated into key findings. Findings: Results indicated that faculty were interested and engaged in the development of the interdisciplinary course, and students were engaged in interdisciplinary learning and developed communication and education skills through experiential place-based learning. Practical Implications: Faculty developed a common understanding of their different disciplinary perspectives that helped provide a more cohesive and complementary interdisciplinary learning experience for students. Students learned about global challenges while identifying similar challenges in their local communities through the experiential learning assignments. Theoretical Implications: The design of the interdisciplinary course helped students think critically and creatively to learn complex issues. Advances in technology and active learning support a flipped classroom model to engage students. Place-based learning combined with interdisciplinary classroom experiences connected students to local real-world contexts and provided students with practical applications of problem-solving, critical thinking, and systems thinking skills. Originality/Value: Graduate students conducted an asset and needs assessment, which connected them to professionals in the community. Students think food and nutritional security, hunger, and sustainability are global challenges and seldom notice food insecurity in their local communities. © 2019, © 2019 Wageningen University.},

abstract={Static analysis tools are programs that run on source code prior to their compilation to binary executables and attempt to find flaws or defects in the code during the early stages of development. If left unresolved, these flaws could pose security risks. While numerous static analysis tools exist, there is no single tool that is optimal. Therefore, many static analysis tools are often used to analyze code. Further, some of the alerts generated by the static analysis tools are low-priority or false alarms. Machine learning algorithms have been developed to distinguish between true alerts and false alarms, however significant man hours need to be dedicated to labeling data sets for training. This study investigates the use of active learning to reduce the number of labeled alerts needed to adequately train a classifier. The numerical experiments demonstrate that a query by committee active learning algorithm can be utilized to significantly reduce the number of labeled alerts needed to achieve similar performance as a classifier trained on a data set of nearly 60,000 labeled alerts. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={X-ray baggage security screening is a demanding task for aviation and rail transit security; automatic prohibited item detection in X-ray baggage images can help reduce the work of inspectors. However, as many items are placed too close to each other in the baggages, it is difficult to fully trust the detection results of intelligent prohibited item detection algorithms. In this paper, a human-in-the-loop baggage inspection framework is proposed. The proposed framework utilizes the deep-learning-based algorithm for prohibited item detection to find suspicious items in X-ray baggage images, and select manual examination when the detection algorithm cannot determine whether the baggage is dangerous or safe. The advantages of proposed inspection process include: online to capture new sample images for training incrementally prohibited item detection model, and augmented prohibited item detection intelligence with human-computer collaboration. The preliminary experimental results show, human-in-the-loop process by combining cognitive capabilities of human inspector with the intelligent algorithms capabilities, can greatly improve the efficiency of in-baggage security screening. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Advances in modern technology, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous computing, open up new exciting opportunities for technology for animals. This is evidenced by the explosion of products and gadgets available for pets, digital enrichment for captive animals in zoos, sensor based smart farming, etc. At the same time, the emerging discipline of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) marks a new era in the design and development of animal technologies, promoting a more animal-centric approach, considering the needs of the animal in the development process. In this article, we reflect on the ways in which ideas of animal-centric development may impact the development of technology for animals in practice. We start by looking at the process of development for and with animals, and propose a development model facilitating the principles of Agility, Welfare of Animals, and eXperts’ involvement (AWAX) within the development lifecycle. While promoting the animal-centric approach, it is important to acknowledge that an animal usually uses technology through humans and in a particular environment. We further extend the AWAX model to include considerations of the human in the loop and the environment, and discuss some practical implications of this view, including aspects such as security and privacy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to report on a case study concerning the development of sustainable energy partnerships involving engineering faculty and undergraduate students at the University of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. Design/methodology/approach: Faculty were motivated to seek partnerships with public and private entities in the local area for the purposes of realising mutually beneficial outcomes. The educational programmes of future engineers, when sustainability is considered, are analysed. Education for sustainable development has to include multidisciplinary active learning as a desirable competence. Active learning can be obtained when problems are based on real life because they are most motivating for students. Constructive alignment component is obtained because learning objectives are linked with learning activities related to the needs of public and private entities. Findings: Through the provision of technical expertise, the adoption and success of renewable energy projects was facilitated on the one hand, while final year undergraduate students benefited in terms of hands-on experience in helping to bring these projects to life, drawing on the knowledge and skills they had acquired throughout their degree programmes. These works are addressed to students by faculty members with the aim of developing and promoting renewable energies. Outcomes from partnerships surpassed expectations; not only were different benefits realised as were initially hoped for, but this success led to partnerships being sustained over time. Originality/value: Fossil fuel-based energy systems are associated with a myriad of negative environmental and social externalities. It is difficult to overstate the importance of transitioning towards alternative low carbon energy sources for climate change mitigation which are less centralised compared to the status-quo for energy security and energy independence. By actively facilitating the development of decentralised renewable energy sources in Catalonia, the projects reported herein are of significant value in social environmental and educational terms. © 2019, Lluís Pacheco, Luo Ningsu, Toni Pujol, Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Inès Ferrer.},

abstract={As frequent users of social networking applications, middle and high school students are well-suited for curricular interventions that leverage these technologies. Allowing students to see “behind the curtain” of these applications provides them with a unique opportunity to better understand the discipline of computer science upon which these technologies are built and influences their perceptions of computer security and privacy. We present a novel social networking simulation that allows students to create a social network account, including profile data and images, and to manage privacy settings and friend connections. The platform, named Fakesbook, presents students with a visualization of the social network as a graph, enabling them to observe the spread of profile data (theirs and others') depending on friend connections and choices of privacy settings. We additionally present our lab curriculum which uses Fakesbook to enable active learning and adversarial thinking to engage students and build agency with regard to privacy and computing concepts. We deployed and, over several years, evaluated our platform and curriculum with hundreds of students from a diverse set of backgrounds at educational events designed to introduce these populations to computer science, cybersecurity, and privacy. Survey results indicate that students gained or deepened their understanding of online privacy and security and that 86% of participants found that Fakesbook helped them “think about privacy and computer security. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={The transition from the traditional power grid to the smart grid improves reliability, performance, and management, while simultaneously increasing its susceptibility to cyberattacks. One of the biggest weaknesses in grid security is the human agent responsible for its maintenance and operations. As such, it is crucial to embed hands-on understanding of grid operations and security, especially for students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) fields. This paper presents a case study where ECE students from Temple University used an interactive microgrid simulator, "Grid Game", a program developed by Idaho National Laboratory. This case study offers insights into the ECE students' understanding of key engineering principles (microgrid stability, generation control system, generator inertia, energy storage, and grid security) gained by using the simulator program. Furthermore, the human behavior (strategies to prepare for and respond to cyberattacks, and cooperation and conflict in decision-making) of defenders/ECE students as they experience cyberattacks are also discussed. The paper then offers some limitations and possible suggestions for future research. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Although wireless sensor network applications are still at early stages of development in the industry, it is obvious that it will pervasively come true and billions of embedded microcomputers will become online for the purpose of remote sensing, actuation and sharing information. According to the estimations, there will be 50 billion connected sensors or things by the year 2020. As we are developing first to market wireless sensor-actuator network devices, we have chance to identify design parameters, define technical infrastructure and make an effort to meet scalable system requirements. In this manner, required research and development activities must involve several research directions such as massive scaling, creating information and big data, robustness, security, privacy and human-in-the-loop. In this study, wireless sensor networks and Internet of things concepts are not only investigated theoretically but also the proposed system is designed and implemented end-to-end. Low rate wireless personal area network sensor nodes with random network coding capability are used for remote sensing and actuation. Low throughput embedded IP gateway node is developed utilizing both random network coding at low rate wireless personal area network side and low overhead websocket protocol for cloud communications side.

abstract={The energy sector worldwide has embarked on a transformational process to modernize the over-a-century-old power grid under an umbrella term of the Smart Grid. This vast infrastructural upgrade and operational change involves integration of a variety of advanced digital computing, communications and industrial control technologies. This brings new capabilities, but also necessitates a re-education of the aging workforce and training of the emerging workforce. While training does exist, the training approach and the accessibility of that training is often at odds with the needs of the utilities. To support this education and training need, in this paper we introduce the beginning of a modular, hands-on and open Smart Grid cybersecurity educational training platform and supporting materials together with an assessment of a preliminary version leveraged at the Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power Grid (TCIPG) Summer School held in 2013. We base pedagogical pillars onto: (1) Active Learning that promotes analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of the content from Bloom's taxonomy, (2) The theory of project-based learning, (3) Piaget's learn-by-doing posture, and (4) Constructivist perspective of education. The main goal of this effort is to develop a complete, phased, and modular learning platform to provide the essential base knowledge and hands-on training exercises for understanding and demonstrating competency in Smart Grid cybersecurity. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The Center for Advanced Engineering and Research (CAER) recently formed the INCONTROL (Integrated Control Room and Operator Performance Laboratory) Group, an industry-university consortium that facilitates cross-disciplinary research teams to address critical technical challenges in the areas of digital instrumentation and control (I&C) systems, human machine interface, plant operations and cyber security for nuclear power environments. The primary effort has been the design, development, construction and operation of an advanced control room and integrated I&C research facility that includes a 2500 sq. ft. configurable control room. This control room is outfitted with modular console furniture, multiple operator workstations, and fully equipped with human performance measurement equipment, including audio-video recorders, wearable eye-trackers, and physiological monitoring capabilities, with synchronized data collection and analysis software applications that can tie to plant simulators. This laboratory is complemented with an integrated digital I&C laboratory equipped with configurable I&C platforms and actual protection and control I&C systems that enables research in integrated controls, cyber security and human performance control room design. The approach is to integrate the disciplines together to provide a realistic representation of both control room operations and the functionality and behavior of digital I&C systems. A recent milestone has been the conducting of a human-in-the-loop experiment with previously licensed operators, demonstrating the merits of the facility for technology evaluation, particularly in the context of integrated system validation. Future work will include integrating the digital I&C equipment with the simulators to enable hardware-and-human-in-the-loop experiments for advanced research in the area of nuclear safety and cyber-security. In 2012 NPIC & HMIT, we presented the strategic vision of INCONTROL to the industry. This paper reports on the progress and lessons learned in advancing and demonstrating the research capabilities of the facility to carry out the strategic vision.},

abstract={An ever increasing volume of data is nowadays becoming available in a streaming manner in many application areas, such as, in critical infrastructure systems, finance and banking, security and crime and web analytics. To meet this new demand, predictive models need to be built online where learning occurs on-the-fly. Online learning poses important challenges that affect the deployment of online classification systems to real-life problems. In this paper we investigate learning from limited labelled, nonstationary and imbalanced data in online classification. We propose a learning method that synergistically combines siamese neural networks and active learning. The proposed method uses a multi-sliding window approach to store data, and maintains separate and balanced queues for each class. Our study shows that the proposed method is robust to data nonstationarity and imbalance, and significantly outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both learning speed and performance. Importantly, it is effective even when only 1% of the labels of the arriving instances are available. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With the exponential growth of information and communication technology, the traditional power system is gradually evolving into a cyber physical energy system (CPES) with frequently interactions between physical and cyber components. CPES indeed revolutionize the power grid efficiency and operational performance, but it also gives rise to new security challenges, causing catastrophic consequences in power system. Therefore, this article proposes a new false data injection attack (FDIA) detection mechanism to automatically recognize the intrusions and thereby improve the cybersecurity of CPES. In this mechanism, a two-stage FDIA model is developed to generate training dataset for the machine learning-based detector, and an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier is meticulously designed by combining with active learning and Bayesian optimization techniques to improve training efficiency and model performance respectively. The proposed FDIA defense strategy can properly extract the nonstationary and nonlinear attacking features and thus locate the biased states with a high accuracy. The obtained numerical results on the standard IEEE 14-, 57- and 118-bus systems highlight the destructive effects of the developed two-stage FDIA and comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDIA detection mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Deception, an art of making someone believe in something that is not true, may provide a promising real-time solution against cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a human-in-the-loop real-world simulation tool called HackIT, which could be configured to create different cyber-security scenarios involving deception. We discuss how researchers can use HackIT to create networks of different sizes; use deception and configure different webservers as honeypots; and, create any number of fictitious ports, services, fake operating systems, and fake files on honeypots. Next, we report a case-study involving HackIT where adversaries were tasked with stealing information from a simulated network over multiple rounds. In one condition in HackIT, deception occurred early; and, in the other condition, it occurred late. Results revealed that participants used different attack strategies across the two conditions. We discuss the potential of using HackIT in helping cyber-security teams understand adversarial cognition in the laboratory. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

In the video surveillance system, false detection of an abnormal situation becomes a big problem. If surveillance user can guide the false detection case as human in the loop, the surveillance system can learn the case and reduce the false detection error in the future.

abstract={Building floor plans with locations of safety, security and energy assets such as IoT sensors, thermostats, fire sprinklers, EXIT signs, fire alarms, smoke detectors, routers etc. are vital for climate control, emergency security, safety, and maintenance of building infrastructure. Existing approaches to building survey are manual, and usually involve an operator with a clipboard and pen, or a tablet enumerating and localizing assets in each room. In this paper, we propose an interactive method for a human operator to use an app on a smart phone to (a) create the 2D layout of a room, (b) detect assets of interest, and (c) localize them within the layout. We use deep learning methods to train a neural network to recognize assets of interest, and use human in the loop interactive methods to correct erroneous recognitions by the networks. These corrections are then used to improve the accuracy of the system over time as the inspector moves from one room to another in a given building or from one building to the next; this progressive training and testing mechanism makes our system useful in building inspection scenarios where a given class of assets in a building are same instantiation of that object category, thus reducing the problem to instance, rather than category recognition. Experiments show our proposed method to achieve accuracy rate of 76% for testing 102 objects across 10 classes. © Authors 2019.},

abstract={This research concerns the detection of unauthorised access within hospital networks through the real-time analysis of audit logs. Privacy is a primary concern amongst patients due to the rising adoption of Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems. There is growing evidence to suggest that patients may withhold information from healthcare providers due to lack of Trust in the security of EPRs. Yet, patient record data must be available to healthcare providers at the point of care. Ensuring privacy and confidentiality of that data is challenging. Roles within healthcare organisations are dynamic and relying on access control is not sufficient. Through proactive monitoring of audit logs, unauthorised accesses can be detected and presented to an analyst for review. Advanced data analytics and visualisation techniques can be used to aid the analysis of big data within EPR audit logs to identify and highlight pertinent data points. Employing a human-in-the-loop model ensures that suspicious activity is appropriately investigated and the data analytics is continuously improving. This paper presents a system that employs a Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning (HILML) algorithm, in addition to a density-based local outlier detection model. The system is able to detect 145 anomalous behaviours in an unlabelled dataset of 1,007,727 audit logs. This equates to 0.014% of the EPR accesses being labelled as anomalous in a specialist Liverpool (UK) hospital. © 2019 IEEE.},

This short paper claims that identifying and exploring the total recall problems in software engineering is an important task with wide applicability. To make that case, we show that by applying and adapting the state of the art active learning and natural language processing algorithms for solving the total recall problem, two important software engineering tasks can also be addressed: (a) supporting large literature reviews and (b) identifying software security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we conjecture that (c) test case prioritization and (d) static warning identification can also be generalized as and benefit from the total recall problem. The widespread applicability of “total recall” to software engineering suggests that there exists some underlying framework that encompasses not just natural language processing, but a wide range of important software engineering tasks. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Action recognition is an essential task in computer vision due to the variety of prospective applications, such as security surveillance, machine learning, and human–computer interaction. The availability of more video data than ever before and the lofty performance of deep convolutional neural networks also make it essential for action recognition in video. Unfortunately, limited crafted video features and the scarcity of benchmark datasets make it challenging to address the multi-person action recognition task in video data. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network–based Effective Hybrid Learning (EHL) framework for two-person interaction classification in video data. Our approach exploits a pre-trained network model (the VGG16 from the University of Oxford Visual Geometry Group) and extends the Faster R-CNN (region–based convolutional neural network a state-of-the-art detector for image classification). We broaden a semi-supervised learning method combined with an active learning method to improve overall performance. Numerous types of two-person interactions exist in the real world, which makes this a challenging task. In our experiment, we consider a limited number of actions, such as hugging, fighting, linking arms, talking, and kidnapping in two environment such simple and complex. We show that our trained model with an active semi-supervised learning architecture gradually improves the performance. In a simple environment using an Intelligent Technology Laboratory (ITLab) dataset from Inha University, performance increased to 95.6% accuracy, and in a complex environment, performance reached 81% accuracy. Our method reduces data-labeling time, compared to supervised learning methods, for the ITLab dataset. We also conduct extensive experiment on Human Action Recognition benchmarks such as UT-Interaction dataset, HMDB51 dataset and obtain better performance than state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 KSII.},

abstract={Instead of dealing with individual, personal desk-top computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc., experiences and interactions of humans with 'computers' will increasingly take place in the context of interacting with 'smart artefacts' integrated into the environment constituting 'smart ecosystems'. This has serious implications for the research area currently called 'human-computer-interaction'. It includes also a shift in terms of scale and context, ranging from individual devices for personal activities to multiple devices used in group activities and social interactions. This is followed by the progression from smart rooms to smart or cooperative buildings and their extension to smart urban environments as, e.g., smart cities and airports. The trend towards more comprehensive application contexts requires a corresponding shift from a mostly individual person-based, user-centred design approach to a multiple people and multiple devices-based, citizen-centred design approach for smart environments we are confronted with in the urban age. The ubiquitous and pervasive deployment of smart technology in urban environments has serious implications for privacy and security issues. This goes along with an increasing trend of using artificial intelligence for algorithm-based automation and autonomous systems resulting in a loss of having humans in the loop and in control. Thus, the future of human-computer interaction is characterized by the challenge of addressing the corresponding design trade-offs and the need to rethink and redefine the 'smart-everything' paradigm in order to move beyond 'smart-only' cities to Humane, Sociable and Cooperative Hybrid Cities and Societies.

abstract={In order to improve the performance of semi-supervised learning, a kind of safe semi-supervised classification algorithm based active learning sampling strategy is proposed. First, an active learning sampling method based on uncertainty and representativenes is designed. The weighted algorithm combining the uncertainty and representativenesss is used to select the unlabeled samples with rich information and representation, providing for semi-supervised learning. Second, a method of label prediction based on grouping verification is designed. Prelabeling is executed on unlabeled sample selected by active learning. The sample with pseudo-label is added into the labeled sample set to carry out grouping, training and testing. The corresponding errors of various pseudo-labels are calculated and the pseudo-label making the accuracy least is selected as the candidate label of the unlabeled sample. Third, a method of security verification is designed. Only the label making the accuracy lower than before is selected as the final label of the unlabeled sample to expand the number of labeled samples. Iterations are repeatedly executed until a certain precision is met. Finally, the classifier is trained using the final labeled set. The experiments are carried out on semi-supervised datasets and UCI datasets, and the results show that the proposed algorithms are effective. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={The ability to search for radiation sources is of interest to the Homeland Security community. The hope is to find any radiation sources which may pose a reasonable chance for harm in a terrorist act. The best chance of success for search operations generally comes with fielding as many detection systems as possible. In doing this, the hoped for encounter with the threat source will inevitably be buried in an even larger number of encounters with non-Threatening radiation sources commonly used for many medical and industrial use. The problem then becomes effectively filtering the non-Threatening sources, and presenting the human-in-The-loop with a modest list of potential threats. Our approach is to field a collection of detection systems which utilize soft-sensing algorithms for the purpose of discriminating potential threat and non-Threat objects, based on a variety of machine learning techniques. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

abstract={Cyber-attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as unmanned vehicles, are emergent threats with potentially catastrophic impacts, and this issue has drawn considerable interest by military agencies. Abundant body of research has attempted to address the physical security aspects of CPS; however, research addressing the human dimensions of cyber-attack detection and responses from an operator and operational perspective is sparse. This research has provided a novel probe into the human factors affecting operator resilience in responding to cyber-attacks, which are situations characterized by uncertainty and malicious intent. The variability of individual operators makes it improbable to grasp the full range of factors contributing to operator performance; however, the application of Suspicion Theory as proposed by Bobko et al. (2013), provides a starting point to aid in understanding operator performance in situations involving malicious intent (e.g. a cyber-attack). According to the theory, malicious intent is a critical component of operator suspicion, which is a key factor in operator response to cyber-attacks. The current research explored this human dimension through scenario-based, human-in-the-loop simulation experiments with Air Force personnel. It included both abstract and empirical assessments of the application of Suspicion Theory to operator detection and responses to cyber-attacks against an unmanned vehicle system, and it took a systems-oriented approach to the problem by considering the interaction of a Human-Machine Team (HMT) in the response. The HMT here refers to an operator and a Sentinel, which is an automated cyber-attack detection aid. The study evaluated the effects of suspicion, as well as the effects of perceived consequence, on the operator, and the resulting HMT quality of performance in responding to alerts, including both false alarms and properly detected cyber-attack scenarios. The findings show that Sentinel alerts alone do not create operator suspicion. Instead, alerts can serve as a catalyst for a wider information search by the operator, which, on a situational basis can lead to formation of increased operator suspicion. The analysis of experimental results pointed to a negative correlation between operator suspicion and performance score that measured the quality of a response to the given scenario. In addition, a strong correlation between HMT performance score and task response time was noted. Copyright 2017 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.},

abstract={Manual GUI testing involves providing inputs to the software via its GUI and determining the software's correctness using its outputs, one of them being the GUI itself. Because of its human-in-the-loop nature, GUI testing is known to be a time-consuming activity. In practice, it is done by junior, inexpensive testers to keep costs low at the very tail-end of the software development process. In this paper, we posit that the importance of GUI testing has suffered due to its traditional narrow role - to detect residual software defects. Because of its human-in-the-loop nature, GUI testing has the potential to provide outputs other than defects and to be used as inputs to several downstream activities, e.g., security analysis. One such output is the mental model that the GUI tester creates during testing, a model that implicitly informs the tester of the software designer's intent. To evaluate our claim, we consider an important question used for security assessment of Android apps: "What permission-sensitive behaviors does this app exhibit?" Our assessment is based on the comparison of 2 mental models of 12 Android apps - one derived from the app's usage and the other from its public description. We compare these two models with a third, automatically derived model - the permissions the app seeks from the Android OS. Our results show that the usage-based model provides unique insights into app behavior. This model may be an important outcome of GUI testing, and its consistency with other behavioral information about the app could later be used in software quality assurance activities such as security assessment. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the runtime verification problem of robot motion planning with human-in-the-loop. By bringing together approaches from runtime verification, trust model, and symbolic motion planning, we developed a framework which guarantees that a robot is able to safely satisfy task specifications while improving task efficiency by switches between human supervision and autonomous motion planning. A simple robot model in a domain path planning scenario is considered and the robot is assumed to have perfect localization capabilities. The task domain is partitioned into a finite number of identical cells. A trust model based on the robot and human performance is used to provide a switching logic between different modes. Model checking techniques are utilized to generate plans in autonomous motion planning and for this purpose, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) as a task specification language is employed to formally express specifications in model checking. The whole system is implemented in a runtime verification framework to monitor and verifies the system execution at runtime using ROSRV. Finally, we illustrated the effectiveness of this framework as well as its feasibility through a simulated case study. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.},

abstract={Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) has become the core technology for numerous application fields ranging from self-driving cars to smart cities. Smart healthcare, as an important part of smart cities, constitutes one of the most essential pillars of social and economic stability. Despite all the possibilities offered by smart healthcare, how to handle the dark aspects of smart healthcare such as security, privacy and trust issues, and so on remains unsolved. In this paper, we focus on designing a human-in-the-loop-aided (HitL-aided) scheme to preserve privacy in smart healthcare. On the one hand, a block design technique is employed to obfuscate various health indicators from the hospitals and the smart wearable devices. On the other hand, human-in-the-loop (HitL) is introduced to enable a privacy access of the health reports from the smart healthcare platform. In addition, the performance analysis and case study indicate that the proposed HitL-aided scheme is effective in preserving privacy for smart healthcare. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Software engineers can find vulnerabilities with less effort if they are directed towards code that might contain more vulnerabilities. HARMLESS is an incremental support vector machine tool that builds a vulnerability prediction model from the source code inspected to date, then suggests what source code files should be inspected next. In this way, HARMLESS can reduce the time and effort required to achieve some desired level of recall for finding vulnerabilities. The tool also provides feedback on when to stop (at that desired level of recall) while at the same time, correcting human errors by double-checking suspicious files. This paper evaluates HARMLESS on Mozilla Firefox vulnerability data. HARMLESS found 80, 90, 95, 99 percent of the vulnerabilities by inspecting 10, 16, 20, 34 percent of the source code files. When targeting 90, 95, 99 percent recall, HARMLESS could stop after inspecting 23, 30, 47 percent of the source code files. Even when human reviewers fail to identify half of the vulnerabilities (50 percent false negative rate), HARMLESS could detect 96 percent of the missing vulnerabilities by double-checking half of the inspected files. Our results serve to highlight the very steep cost of protecting software from vulnerabilities (in our case study that cost is, for example, the human effort of inspecting 28,750 × 20% = 5,750 source code files to identify 95 percent of the vulnerabilities). While this result could benefit the mission-critical projects where human resources are available for inspecting thousands of source code files, the research challenge for future work is how to further reduce that cost. The conclusion of this paper discusses various ways that goal might be achieved. © 1976-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based applications utilize current technological advancements for purposes of streaming data, as a way of adapting to the ever-changing technological landscape. Such efforts require providing accurate, meaningful, and trustworthy output from the streaming sensors particularly during dynamic virtual sensing. However, to ensure that the sensing ecosystem is devoid of any sensor threats or active attacks, it is paramount to implement secure real-time strategies. Fundamentally, real-time detection of adversarial attacks/instances during the User Feedback Process (UFP) is the key to forecasting potential attacks in active learning. Also, according to existing literature, there lacks a comprehensive study that has a focus on adversarial detection from an active machine learning perspective at the time of writing this paper. Therefore, the authors posit the importance of detecting adversarial attacks in active learning strategy. Attack in the context of this paper through a UFP-Threat driven model has been presented as any action that exerts an alteration to the learning system or data. To achieve this, the study employed ambient data collected from a smart environment human activity recognition from (Continuous Ambient Sensors Dataset, CASA) with fully labeled connections, where we intentionally subject the Dataset to wrong labels as a targeted/manipulative attack (by a malevolent labeler) in the UFP, with an assumption that the user-labels were connected to unique identities. While the dataset's focus is to classify tasks and predict activities, our study gives a focus on active adversarial strategies from an information security point of view. Furthermore, the strategies for modeling threats have been presented using the Meta Attack Language (MAL) compiler for purposes adversarial detection. The findings from the experiments conducted have shown that real-time adversarial identification and profiling during the UFP could significantly increase the accuracy during the learning process with a high degree of certainty and paves the way towards an automated adversarial detection and profiling approaches on the Internet of Cognitive Things (ICoT). © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Generally, in-the-wild emotions are complex in nature. They often occur in combinations of multiple basic emotions, such as fear, happy, disgust, anger, sadness and surprise. Unlike the basic emotions, annotation of complex emotions, such as pain, is a time-consuming and expensive exercise. Moreover, there is an increasing demand for profiling such complex emotions as they are useful in many real-world application domains, such as medical, psychology, security and computer science. The traditional emotion recognition systems require a significant amount of annotated training samples to understand the complex emotions. This limits the direct applicability of those methods for complex emotion detection from images and videos. Therefore, it is important to learn the profile of the in-the-wild complex emotions accurately using limited annotated samples. In this paper, we propose a deep framework to incrementally and actively profile in-the-wild complex emotions, from sparse data. Our approach consists of three major components, namely a pre-processing unit, an optimization unit and an active learning unit. The pre-processing unit removes the variations present in the complex emotion images extracted from an uncontrolled environment. Our novel incremental active learning algorithm along with an optimization unit effectively predicts the complex emotions present in-the-wild. Evaluation using multiple complex emotions benchmark datasets reveals that our proposed approach performs close to the human perception capability in effectively profiling complex emotions. Further, our proposed approach shows a significant performance enhancement, in comparison with the state-of-the-art deep networks and other benchmark complex emotion profiling approaches. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Network mining plays a pivotal role in many high-impact application domains, including information retrieval, healthcare, social network analysis, security and recommender systems. State-of-the-art offers a wealth of sophisticated network mining algorithms, many of which have been widely adopted in real-world with superior empirical performance. Nonetheless, they often lack effective and efficient ways to characterize how the results of a given mining task relate to the underlying network structure. In this paper, we introduce network derivative mining problem. Given the input network and a specific mining algorithm, network derivative mining finds a derivative network whose edges measure the influence of the corresponding edges of the input network on the mining results. We envision that network derivative mining could be beneficial in a variety of scenarios, ranging from explainable network mining, adversarial network mining, sensitivity analysis on network structure, active learning, learning with side information to counterfactual learning on networks. We propose a generic framework for network derivative mining from the optimization perspective and provide various instantiations for three classic network mining tasks, including ranking, clustering, and matrix completion. For each mining task, we develop effective algorithm for constructing the derivative network based on influence function analysis, with numerous optimizations to ensure a linear complexity in both time and space. Extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework and algorithms. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Cybersecurity competitions have been shown to be an effective approach for promoting student engagement through active learning in cybersecurity. Players can gain hands-on experience in puzzle-based or capture-the-flag type tasks that promote learning. However, novice players with limited prior knowledge in cybersecurity usually found difficult to have a clue to solve a problem and get frustrated at the early stage. To enhance student engagement, it is important to study the experiences of novices to better understand their learning needs. To achieve this goal, we conducted a 4-month longitudinal case study which involves 11 undergraduate students participating in a college-level cybersecurity competition, National Cyber League (NCL) competition. The competition includes two individual games and one team game. Questionnaires and in-person interviews were conducted before and after each game to collect the players' feedback on their experience, learning challenges and needs, and information about their motivation, interests and confidence level. The collected data demonstrate that the primary concern going into these competitions stemmed from a lack of knowledge regarding cybersecurity concepts and tools. Players' interests and confidence can be increased by going through systematic training. © 2019 IEEE.},

In this new setting, edge devices with distributed computing capability, such as sensors, surveillance camera, can communicate with fog nodes with less latency. Furthermore, local computing (at edge side) may improve privacy and trust. In this paper, we present a new method, in which, we decompose the data processing, by dividing them between edge devices and fog nodes, intelligently. We apply active learning on edge devices; and federated learning on the fog node which significantly reduces the data samples to train the model as well as the communication cost.

abstract={Wind speed prediction is the key to wind power prediction, which is very important to guarantee the security and stability of the power system. Due to dramatic changes in wind speed, it needs high-frequency sampling to describe the wind. A large number of samples are generated and affect modeling time and accuracy. Therefore, two novel active learning methods with sample selection are proposed for short-term wind speed prediction. The main objective of active learning is to minimize the number of training samples and ensure the prediction accuracy. In order to verify the validity of the proposed methods, the results of support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models with different training sets are compared. The experimental data are from a wind farm in Jiangsu Province. The simulation results show that the two novel active learning methods can effectively select typical samples. While reducing the number of training samples, the prediction performance remains almost the same or slightly improved. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Emergent cyber-attack threats against cyber-physical systems can create potentially catastrophic impacts. The operators must intervene at the right moment when suspected attacks occur, without over-reliance on systems to detect the cyber-attacks. However, military operators are normally trained to trust, rather than suspect systems. We applied suspicion theory to explore how operators detect and respond to cyber-attacks against an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system in the operational context of a human-machine team (HMT). We investigated the relationships between the operator suspicion and HMT performance by conducting human-in-the-loop experiments on eight mission scenarios with 32 air-force officers. The experiment yielded a significant, negative relationship between operator suspicion and HMT performance (quantified both in terms of the desirability of decision response and the time to respond). Notably, operator suspicion increased with the combined effects of cyber-attacks and a sentinel alert but not with the alert alone. This finding was particularly meaningful for 'false-negative' scenarios, in which no sentinel alert was sent despite cyber-attacks having occurred. Although the operators did not receive an alert, the operators grew more suspicious, seeking more information; it took longer for the operators to respond, and their decision responses were highly divergent (17.2% came with less-desirable responses, and 21.9% were considered instances of over-reliance). In contrast, in 'false-positive' scenarios, 95.3% of the operator responses were highly desirable. This experiment has implications for the role of a sentinel alert in engineering trustworthy HMT systems so that the operators can quickly transition through state-suspicion to the most desirable decision. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is transforming the world into Smart Cities, which have a huge impact on future societal lifestyle, economy and business. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially IoT-enabled Electric Vehicles (EVs), are anticipated to be an integral part of future Smart Cities. Assuring ITS safety and security is critical to the success of Smart Cities because human lives are at stake. The state-of-the-art understanding of this matter is very superficial because there are many new problems that have yet to be investigated. For example, the cyber-physical nature of ITS requires considering human-in-the-loop (i.e., drivers and pedestrians) and imposes many new challenges. In this paper, we systematically explore the threat model against ITS safety and security (e.g., malfunctions of connected EVs/transportation infrastructures, driver misbehavior and unexpected medical conditions, and cyber attacks). Then, we present a novel and systematic ITS safety and security architecture, which aims to reduce accidents caused or amplified by a range of threats. The architecture has appealing features: (i) it is centered at proactive cyber-physical-human defense; (ii) it facilitates the detection of early-warning signals of accidents; (iii) it automates effective defense against a range of threats. © 2018 ACM.},

However, due to its non-linear architecture and high-dimensional inputs, its ill-posedness [1] towards adversarial perturbations - small deliberately crafted perturbations on the input will lead to completely different outputs, has also attracted researchers' attention. 1 This work takes the traffic sign recognition system on the selfdriving car as an example, and aims at designing an additional mechanism to improve the robustness of the recognition system. It uses a machine learning model which learns the results of the deep learning model's predictions, with human feedback as labels and provides the credibility of current prediction. The mechanism makes use of both the input image and the recognition result as the sample space, querying a human user the True/False of current classification result the least number of times, and completing the task of detecting adversarial attacks. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Extensive deployment of sensor networks in recent years has led to the generation of large volumes of data. One approach to processing such large volumes of data is to rely on parallelized approaches based on architectures such as MapReduce. However, fully-automated processing without human intervention is error prone. Supporting human involvement in processing pipelines of data in a variety of contexts such as warfare, cyber security, threat monitoring, and malware analysis leads to improved decision-making. Although this kind of human-machine collaboration seems straightforward, involving a human operator into an automated processing pipeline presents some challenges. For example, due to the asynchronous nature of the human intervention, care must be taken to ensure that once a user-made correction or assertion is introduced, all necessary adjustment and reprocessing is performed. In addition, to make the best use of limited resources and processing capabilities, reprocessing of data in light of such corrections must be minimized. This paper introduces an innovative approach for human-machine integration in decisionmaking for large-scale sensor networks that rely on the popular Hadoop MapReduce framework. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we present an approach to recognize individual persons in aerial video data. We start from a baseline approach that matches a number of color and texture image features in order to find possible matches to a query person track. This approach is improved by incorporating operator feedback in three ways. First, features are being weighted based on their degree of agreement (correlation) to the operator feedback. Second, a classifier is trained based on the operator feedback. This classifier learns to distinguish the query person from others. Third, we use feedback from past queries to further restrict the search space and improve feature selection as well as provide additional classifier training data. Finally we also investigate active learning strategies to select those results that the operator should label in order to gain the highest possible improvement of accuracy in the next iteration. We evaluate our approach on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate improvements over the baseline as well as over a previous work. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.},

abstract={In the field of network security, the process of labeling a network traffic dataset is specially expensive since expert knowledge is required to perform the annotations. With the aid of visual analytic applications such as RiskID, the effort of labeling network traffic is considerable reduced. However, since the label assignment still requires an expert pondering several factors, the annotation process remains a difficult task. The present article introduces a novel active learning strategy for building a random forest model based on user previously-labeled connections. The resulting model provides to the user an estimation of the probability of the remaining unlabeled connections helping him in the traffic annotation task. The article describes the active learning strategy, the interfaces with the RiskID system, the algorithms used to predict botnet behavior, and a proposed evaluation framework. The evaluation framework includes studies to assess not only the prediction performance of the active learning strategy but also the learning rate and resilience against noise as well as the improvements on other well known labeling strategies. The framework represents a complete methodology for evaluating the performance of any active learning solution. The evaluation results showed proposed approach is a significant improvement over previous labeling strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The inference algorithm generates inputs and database contents, runs the application, then observes the resulting database traffic and outputs to progressively refine its current model hypothesis. Because the technique works with only externally observable inputs, outputs, and database contents, it can infer the behavior of applications written in arbitrary languages using arbitrary coding styles (as long as the behavior of the application is expressible in the domain-specific language). Konure also implements a regenerator that produces a translated Python implementation of the application that systematically includes relevant security and error checks. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={The smart grid is expected to self-heal, self-optimize, self-configure, and self-protect from physical and cyber-disturbances. These requirements are expected to be built into intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), which would enable autonomous control of power distribution buses in the smart grid. Power distribution buses are used to redistribute electric loads across power generation sources, control voltage/VAR, satisfy economic dispatch objectives and improve the resiliency of the grid against physical disturbance and cyber-attacks. The current power grid has a centralized communication system with a centralized human-in-the-loop controller (such as in a typical SCADA system)in order to adjust operating configurations of equipment within a distribution zone. Implementing autonomous functions by moving from a centralized control architecture to a decentralized architecture can empower bus controllers with greater control over local equipment and operations. We present the secure overlay communication model (SOCOM)for smart microgrids as a solution to decentralizing the traditional centralized control architecture and a decentralized communication platform for peer bus controllers to operate and optimize operations of the grid. We demonstrate the utility of this overlay model in an 11-Bus microgrid network to achieve self-healing. Using this model, we were able to accurately detect data modification attacks that target the controller's state-estimation and malicious control of switching devices. © 2019},

abstract={Security operations centers (SOCs) employ various cyber defend measures to monitor network events. Apart from these measures, SOCs also have to resort to human analysts to make sense of the collected data for incident detection and response. However, with the oncoming network data collected and accumulated at a rapid speed, analysts are usually overwhelmed by tedious and repeated data triage tasks so that they can hardly concentrate on in-depth analysis to create timely and quality incident reports. This paper aims to reduce the analysts' workloads by developing data triage automatons. We have developed a computer-aided tracing method for capturing analysts' operations while they are performing a task. This paper proposes a graph-based trace mining approach for constructing useful patterns for data triage from the operation traces. Finite state machines can be constructed based on the rules to automate data triage. A human-in-the-loop case study is conducted to evaluate our approach, in which 30 professional analysts were recruited and asked to complete a cyber-analysis task with their operations being traced. State machines were constructed based on the traces and then the effectiveness of developing state machines and the performance of state machines are evaluated. The result shows that it is feasible to conduct automated data triage by leveraging analysts' traces. The state machines are able to complete processing a large amount of data within minutes. Comparing the performance of automated data triage with the ground truth, we found that a satisfactory false positive rate can be achieved. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={In cyber-physical transportation systems (CPTS), moving vehicles and road sensors transmit traffic information to controllers via wireless networks. Because of the open property of the wireless communications, the CPTS are vulnerable to security attacks, e.g., malicious eavesdropping and jamming. Furthermore, for the smart eavesdropper and jammer, which can adjust their attack strategies according to the transmission power of information, it is a challenge to learn the strategy of a security attack, and further to adjust the transmission power against the attack. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, Deep-SCPT, to learn such a kind of strategy (it can be considered as the feature of an attack). This model uses unsupervised learning to achieve an active learning process. Extensive experiments are carried out with 10 different datasets, and the results illustrate that the deep learning model achieves an average gain of 6% accuracy compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Cybersecurity games are an attractive and popular method of active learning. However, the majority of current games are created for advanced players, which often leads to frustration in less experienced learners. Therefore, we decided to focus on a diagnostic assessment of participants entering the games. We assume that information about the players' knowledge, skills, and experience enables tutors or learning environments to suitably assist participants with game challenges and maximize learning in their virtual adventure. In this paper, we present a pioneering experiment examining the predictive value of a short quiz and self-assessment for identifying learners' readiness before playing a cybersecurity game. We hypothesized that these predictors would model players' performance. A linear regression analysis showed that the game performance can be accurately predicted by well-designed prerequisite testing, but not by self-assessment. At the same time, we identified major challenges related to the design of pretests for cybersecurity games: calibrating test questions with respect to the skills relevant for the game, minimizing the quiz's length while maximizing its informative value, and embedding the pretest in the game. Our results are relevant for educational researchers and cybersecurity instructors of students at all learning levels. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

This problem is especially acute when the analysis task is exploratory in nature, e.g., the discovery of potentially coordinated relationships in massive text datasets. Such tasks are very common in domains like intelligence analysis and security forensics where the goal is to uncover surprising coalitions bridging multiple types of relations. We introduce new maximum entropy models to discover surprising chains of relationships leveraging count data about entity occurrences in documents. These models are embedded in a visual analytic system called MERCER (Maximum Entropy Relational Chain ExploRer) that treats relationship bundles as first class objects and directs the user toward promising lines of inquiry. We demonstrate how user input can judiciously direct analysis toward valid conclusions, whereas a purely algorithmic approach could be led astray.

abstract={Active Learning Method (ALM) is a fuzzy learning method and is inspired by the approach of human's brain toward understanding complicated problems. In this algorithm, a Multi-Input Single-Output system is modeled by some Single-Input Single-Output sub-systems. Each sub-model tries to capture the input-output relationship of each sub-system on a plane called IDS plane. The output of the original system is then approximated by fuzzy aggregation of the output of all submodels. The most important step in ALM, though, is to choose an appropriate radius for ink drop spread, to achieve desirable result. In this paper, a novel method, based on the idea of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, is proposed to locally choose appropriate radius for ink drop spread according to the density of the data points in each region of the IDS plane. It will be shown that by this criterion, not only the sparsity of data points in different regions of the dataset is taken into account, but also the algorithm will be equipped with the capability to identify and filter out the outliers. The mathematical analysis of this method is provided to confirm its validity and simulations were conducted on various datasets in order to evaluate its efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Deep learning techniques have demonstrated the ability to perform a variety of object recognition tasks using visible imager data; however, deep learning has not been implemented as a means to autonomously detect and assess targets of interest in a physical security system. We demonstrate the use of transfer learning on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to significantly reduce training time while keeping detection accuracy of physical security relevant targets high. Unlike many detection algorithms employed by video analytics within physical security systems, this method does not rely on temporal data to construct a background scene; targets of interest can halt motion indefinitely and still be detected by the implemented CNN. A key advantage of using deep learning is the ability for a network to improve over time. Periodic retraining can lead to better detection and higher confidence rates. We investigate training data size versus CNN test accuracy using physical security video data. Due to the large number of visible imagers, significant volume of data collected daily, and currently deployed human in the loop ground truth data, physical security systems present a unique environment that is well suited for analysis via CNNs. This could lead to the creation of algorithmic element that reduces human burden and decreases human analyzed nuisance alarms. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Counteracting cyber threats to ensure secure cyberspace faces great challenges as cyber-attacks are increasingly stealthy and sophisticated; the protected cyber domains exhibit rapidly growing complexity and scale. It is important to design big data-driven cyber security solutions that effectively and efficiently derive actionable intelligence from available heterogeneous sources of information using principled data analytic methods to defend against cyber threats. In this work, we present a scalable distributed framework to collect and process extreme-scale networking and computing system traffic and status data from multiple sources that collectively represent the system under study, and develop and apply real-time adaptive data analytics for anomaly detection to monitor, understand, maintain, and improve cybersecurity. The data analytics will integrate multiple sophisticated machine learning algorithms and human-in-the-loop for iterative ensemble learning. Given the volume, speed, and complex nature of the data gathered, plus the need of real-time data analytics, a scalable data processing framework needs to handle big data with low latency. Our proposed big-data analytics will be implemented using an Apache Spark computing cluster. The analytics developed will offer significant improvements over existing methods of anomaly detection in real time. Our preliminary evaluation studies have shown that the developed techniques achieve better capabilities of defending against cyber threats.},

abstract={Today's mobile platforms provide only coarse-grained permissions to users with regard to how third-party applications use sensitive private data. Unfortunately, it is easy to disguise malware within the boundaries of legitimately-granted permissions. For instance, granting access to "contacts" and "internet" may be necessary for a text-messaging application to function, even though the user does not want contacts transmitted over the internet. To understand fine-grained application use of permissions, we need to statically analyze their behavior. Even then, malware detection faces three hurdles: (1) analyses may be prohibitively expensive, (2) automated analyses can only find behaviors that they are designed to find, and (3) the maliciousness of any given behavior is application-dependent and subject to human judgment. To remedy these issues, we propose semantic-based program analysis, with a human in the loop as an alternative approach to malware detection. In particular, our analysis allows analyst-crafted semantic predicates to search and filter analysis results. Human-oriented semantic-based program analysis can systematically, quickly and concisely characterize the behaviors of mobile applications. We describe a tool that provides analysts with a library of the semantic predicates and the ability to dynamically trade speed and precision. It also provides analysts the ability to statically inspect details of every suspicious state of (abstract) execution in order to make a ruling as to whether or not the behavior is truly malicious with respect to the intent of the application. In addition, permission and profiling reports are generated to aid analysts in identifying common malicious behaviors.},

abstract={Context: The tremendous growth of Android malware in recent years is a strong motivation for the vast endeavor in detection and analysis of malware apps. A prominent approach for this purpose is dynamic analysis in which providing complex interactions with the samples under analysis is a need. Event generation tools are almost used to provide such interactions, but they have deficiencies for effective malware analysis. For example, anti-static and anti-dynamic analysis techniques employed by the malware prevent event generators to extract sufficient information for generating appropriate events. As a result, they fail to trigger malicious payloads or obtain high code coverage in most cases. Objective: In this paper, we aim to present a new framework to improve the event generation process for dynamic analysis of Android malware. Method: We propose MEGDroid, a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) framework in which malware-related information is automatically extracted and represented as a domain-specific model. This model, then is used to generate appropriate events for malware analysis using model-to-model and model-to-code transformations. The proposed model-driven artifacts also provide required facilities to put the human in the loop for properly taking his/her knowledge into account. Results: The proposed framework has been realized as an Eclipse plugin and we performed extensive practical analysis on a set of malware samples selected from the AMD dataset. The experimental results showed that MEGDroid considerably increases the number of triggered malicious payloads as well as the execution code coverage compared with Monkey and DroidBot, as two state of the art general-purpose and malware specific event generators respectively. Conclusion: The proposed MDE approach, enhances the event generation process through both automatic event generation and analyzer user involvement who can efficiently direct the process to increase the effectiveness of the generated events considering small amount of information that is extractable from the malware code. © 2021},

abstract={Six common beliefs about the usage of active learning in introductory STEM courses are investigated using survey data from 3769 instructors. Three beliefs focus on contextual factors: class size, classroom setup, and teaching evaluations; three focus on individual factors: security of employment, research activity, and prior exposure. The analysis indicates that instructors in all situations can and do employ active learning in their courses. However, with the exception of security of employment, trends in the data are consistent with beliefs about the impact of these factors on usage of active learning. We discuss implications of these results for institutional and departmental policies to facilitate the use of active learning. Copyright: © 2021 Apkarian et al.

abstract={Heat transfer is an elementary discipline across to many engineering degrees. As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student's motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject (Ballesteros et al., 2019). In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students. The plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students’ participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10 % of the total course score. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract={Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are increasingly adopting machine learning (ML)-based approaches to detect threats in computer networks due to their ability to learn underlying threat patterns/features. However, ML-based models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, attacks wherein slight perturbations of the input features, cause misclassifications. We propose a method that uses active learning and generative adversarial networks to evaluate the threat of adversarial attacks on ML-based IDS. Existing adversarial attack methods require a large amount of training data or assume knowledge of the IDS model itself (e.g., loss function), which may not be possible in real-world settings. Our method overcomes these limitations by demonstrating the ability to compromise an IDS using limited training data and assuming no prior knowledge of the IDS model other than its binary classification (i.e., benign or malicious). Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our proposed model to achieve a 98.86% success rate in bypassing the IDS model using only 25 labeled data points during model training. The knowledge gained by compromising the ML-based IDS, can be integrated into the IDS in order to enhance its robustness against similar ML-based adversarial attacks. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Human activity recognition (HAR) is highly relevant to many real-world domains like safety, security, and in particular healthcare. The current machine learning technology of HAR is highly human-dependent which makes it costly and unreliable in non-stationary environment. Existing HAR algorithms assume that training data is collected and annotated by human a prior to the training phase. Furthermore, the data is assumed to exhibit the true characteristics of the underlying distribution. In this paper, we propose a new autonomous approach that consists of novel algorithms. In particular, we adopt active learning (AL) strategy to selectively query the user/resident about the label of particular activities in order to improve the model accuracy. This strategy helps overcome the challenge of labelling sequential data with time dependency which is highly time-consuming and difficult. Because of the changes that may affect the way activities are performed, we regard sensor data as a stream and human activity learning as an online continuous process. In such process the leaner can adapt to changes, incorporate novel activities and discard obsolete ones. To this extent, we propose a novel semi-supervised classifier (OSC) that works together with a novel Bayesian stream-based active learning (BSAL). Because of the changes in the sensor layouts across different houses’ settings, we use Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) to handle the features engineering issue by learning the features regardless of the environment settings. CRBM is then applied to extract low-level features from unlabelled raw high-dimensional activity input. The resulting approach will then tackle the challenges of activity recognition using a three-module architecture composed of a feature extractor (CRBM), an online semi-supervised classifier (OSC) equipped with BSAL. CRBM-BSAL-OSC allows completely autonomous learning that adjusts to the environment setting, explores the changes and adapt to them. The paper provides the theoretical details of the proposed approach as well as an extensive empirical study to evaluate the performance of the approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Machine learning is being increasingly used by individuals, research institutions, and corporations. This has resulted in the surge of Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) - cloud services that provide (a) tools and resources to learn the model, and (b) a user-friendly query interface to access the model. However, such MLaaS systems raise concerns such as model extraction. In model extraction attacks, adversaries maliciously exploit the query interface to steal the model. More precisely, in a model extraction attack, a good approximation of a sensitive or proprietary model held by the server is extracted (i.e. learned) by a dishonest user who interacts with the server only via the query interface. This attack was introduced by Tramèr et al. at the 2016 USENIX Security Symposium, where practical attacks for various models were shown. We believe that better understanding the efficacy of model extraction attacks is paramount to designing secure MLaaS systems. To that end, we take the first step by (a) formalizing model extraction and discussing possible defense strategies, and (b) drawing parallels between model extraction and established area of active learning. In particular, we show that recent advancements in the active learning domain can be used to implement powerful model extraction attacks, and investigate possible defense strategies. © 2020 by The USENIX Association.

abstract={Recently, vehicle type recognition in surveillance images with deep learning has received significant attention in various applications of intelligent transportation systems. However, annotating large-scale images from many surveillance images is tedious and time-consuming, which impedes its application in the real world. This paper aims to resolve this problem by reducing manual labeling in surveillance images, and then maximizing the effect of the few tagged data. Thus, a deep active learning method with a new query strategy is proposed in this paper for vehicle type recognition in surveillance images. First, the proposed method constructs a memory space using a large-scale fully labeled auxiliary dataset collected from the Internet. Subsequently, two metrics, the similarity measurement in memory space and the entropy, are used to simultaneously emphasize the diversity and uncertainty in the query strategy. Moreover, an additional label-consistent term apart from the hyper-parameters is used to adaptively adjust the combination of the two principles in active learning. The proposed method was evaluated on the Comprehensive Cars dataset.

abstract={Abstract: Network anomaly detection is an important means for safeguarding network security. On account of the difficulties encountered in traditional automatic detection methods such as lack of labeled data, expensive retraining costs for new data and non-explanation, we propose a novel smart labeling method, which combines active learning and visual interaction, to detect network anomalies through the iterative labeling process of the users. The algorithms and the visual interfaces are tightly integrated. The network behavior patterns are first learned by using the self-organizing incremental neural network. Then, the model uses a Fuzzy c-means-based algorithm to do classification on the basis of user feedback. After that, the visual interfaces are updated to present the improved results of the model, which can help users to choose meaningful candidates, judge anomalies and understand the model results. The experiments show that compared to labeling without our visualizations, our method can achieve a high accuracy rate of anomaly detection with fewer labeled samples.

abstract={Adaptive tracking-by-detection is a popular approach to track arbitrary objects in various situations. Such approaches treat tracking as a classification task and constantly update the object model. The update procedure requires a set of labeled examples, where samples are collected from the last observation, and then labeled. However, these intermediate steps typically follow a set of heuristic rules for labeling and uninformed search in the sample space, which decrease the effectiveness of model update. In this study, we present a framework for adaptive tracking that utilizes active learning for effective sample selection and labeling them. The active sampler employs a committee of randomized-classifiers to select the most informative samples and query their label from an auxiliary detector with a long-Term memory. The committee is then updated with the obtained labels. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-The-Art trackers on various benchmark videos. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={As app based paradigms are becoming popular, millions of apps are developed from many domains including energy, health, security, and entertainment. The US FDA expects that there will be 500 million smart phone users downloading healthcare related apps by 2015. Many of these apps are Cyber-Physical System (CPS) apps. In addition to sensing, communication, and computation, they perform interventions to control human physiological parameters, which can cause dependency problems as multiple interventions of multiple apps can increase or decrease each others effects, some of which can be harmful to the user. Such dependency problems occur mainly because each app is unaware about how other apps work and when an app performs an intervention to control its target parameters, it may affect other physiological parameters without even knowing it. We present EyePhy, a system that detects dependencies across interventions by having a closer eye on the physiological parameters of the human in the loop. To do that, EyePhy uses a physiological simulator HumMod that can model the complex interactions of the human physiology using over 7800 variables. EyePhy reduces app developers' efforts in specifying dependency metadata compared to state of the art solutions and offers personalized dependency analysis for the user. We demonstrate the magnitude of dependencies that arise during multiple interventions in a human body and the significant ability of detecting these dependencies using EyePhy.

abstract={Power grids are undergoing a digital transformation are therefore becoming increasingly complex. As a result of this they are also becoming vulnerable in new ways. With this development come also numerous risks. Cybersecurity is therefore becoming crucial for ensuring resilience of this infrastructure which is critical to safety of humans and societies. Risk analysis of cybersecurity in the context of smart power grids is, however, particularly demanding due to its interdisciplinary nature, including domains such as digital security, the energy domain, power networks, the numerous control systems involved, and the human in the loop. This poses special requirements to cybersecurity risk identification within smart power grids, which challenge the existing state-of-the-art. This paper proposes a customized four-step approach to identification and modelling of cybersecurity risks in the context of smart power grids. The aim is that the risk model can be presented to decision makers in a suitable interface, thereby serving as a useful support for planning, design and operation of smart power grids. The approach applied in this study is based on parts of the "CORAS" method for model-based risk analysis. The paper also reports on results and experiences from applying the approach in a realistic industrial case with a distribution system operator (DSO) responsible for hosting a pilot installation of the self-healing functionality within a power distribution grid. The evaluation indicates that the approach can be applied in a realistic setting to identify cybersecurity risks. The experiences from the case study moreover show that the presented approach is, to a large degree, well suited for its intended purpose, but it also points to areas in need for improvement and further evaluation. © 2019 International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk.},

The major issue is these systems could easily be broken if proper protection techniques are not employed. This requires students to understand the offensive approaches that can be used to breach security in order to better understand how to properly defend against cyber attacks. We present a novel approach to teaching cyber security in a graduate course using an innovative assessment task that engages students in both software obfuscation and reverse engineering of obfuscated code. Students involved in the activities gain an appreciation of the challenges in defending against attacks. Our results demonstrate a positive change in the students' perception during the learning process. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The use of surveillance cameras continues to increase, ranging from conventional applications such as law enforcement to newer scenarios with looser requirements such as gathering business intelligence. Humans still play an integral part in using and interpreting the footage from these systems, but are also a significant factor in causing unintentional privacy breaches. As computer vision methods continue to improve, we argue in this position paper that system designers should reconsider the role of machines in surveillance, and how automation can be used to help protect privacy. We explore this by discussing the impact of the human-in-the-loop, the potential for using abstraction and distributed computing to further privacy goals, and an approach for determining when video footage should be hidden from human users. We propose that in an ideal surveillance scenario, a privacy-affirming framework causes collected camera footage to be processed by computers directly, and never shown to humans. This implicitly requires humans to establish trust, to believe that computer vision systems can generate sufficiently accurate results without human supervision, so that if information about people must be gathered, unintentional data collection is mitigated as much as possible. © 2017 IEEE.},

In some security applications such as training anomaly detectors, the data streams may consist of private information or transactions and the output of the learning algorithms may reveal information about the training data. Differential privacy is a framework for quantifying the privacy risk in such settings. This paper proposes two differentially private strategies to mitigate privacy risk when training a classifier for anomaly detection in an online setting. The first is to use a randomized active learning heuristic to screen out uninformative data points in the stream. The second is to use mini-batching to improve classifier performance. Experimental results show how these two strategies can trade off privacy, label complexity, and generalization performance. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Cybersecurity classes should be focused on building practical skills along with the development of the open mindset that is essential to tackle the dynamic cybersecurity landscape. Unfortunately, traditional lecture-style teaching is a poor match for this task. Peer instruction is a non-traditional, active learning approach that has proven to be effective in many fundamental courses of computer science. The main challenge for faculty in adopting peer instruction is the development of conceptual questions. This paper presents a methodology for developing peer instruction questions systematically for cybersecurity courses. The method consists of four stages: concept identification, concept trigger, question presentation, and question development. The paper further provides an analysis of 172 questions developed over the period of ten months by the authors for two cybersecurity courses: introduction to computer security and network penetration testing. Finally, it discusses four examples of peer instruction questions in the context of the aforementioned methodology. © 2016 USENIX Workshop on Advances in Security Education, ASE 2016, co-located with the 25th USENIX Security Symposium.

abstract={Nowadays, video surveillance systems are taking the first steps toward automation, in order to ease the burden on human resources as well as to avoid human error. As the underlying data distribution and the number of concepts change over time, the conventional learning algorithms fail to provide reliable solutions for this setting. In this paper, we formalize a learning concept suitable for multi-camera video surveillance and propose a learning methodology adapted to that new paradigm. The proposed framework resorts to the universal background model to robustly learn individual object models from small samples and to more effectively detect novel classes. The individual models are incrementally updated in an ensemble-based approach, with older models being progressively forgotten. The framework is designed to detect and label new concepts automatically. The system is also designed to exploit active learning strategies, in order to interact wisely with operator, requesting assistance in the most ambiguous to classify observations. The experimental results obtained both on real and synthetic data sets verify the usefulness of the proposed approach. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have extensive applications in both civilian and military applications. Nevertheless, the continued development of UAVs has been accompanied by security concerns. UAV navigation systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks that target their Global Positioning System (GPS). Thus, efficient GPS hacking detection with high success rate is paramount. Significant effort has been put into developing autonomous hacking detection techniques. However, little research has considered how a human operator can contribute to the security of such systems. In this paper, we propose a human-autonomy collaborative approach for a single operator of multiple-UAV supervisory control systems, where human geo-location is used to help detect possible UAV cyber-attacks. An experiment was designed and conducted using the RESCHU-SA experiment platform to evaluate this approach. The primary results show that 65% of all experiment sessions reached over 80% success rate in UAV hacking detection, while only 17% of participants lost one or more UAVs because of incorrect hacking detections. These results suggest that such an approach could help achieve better security guarantees for human-in-the-loop autonomous UAV systems that are prone to cyber-attacks. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={While the scale, frequency and impact of the recent cyber- and DoS-attacks have all increased, the traditional security management systems are still supervised by human operators in the decisional loop. To cope with the new breed of machine-driven attacks - particularly those designed to overload the humans in the loop - the next-generation anomaly detection and attack mitigation schema, i.e. the network security management, must improve greatly in speed and accuracy: become machine-driven, too. As infrastructure we propose an FPGA-accelerated Network Function Virtualization that potentially enhances the current multi-Tbps switching fabrics with SDN-based security capabilities of vastly higher performance and scalability. As key novelties, we contribute (i) sub-ms detection lag (ii) of the top 9 Akamai attacks [1] with (iii) a real-time SDN feedback loop between a distributed programmable data plane and a centralized SDN controller, (iv) coupled via a global N:1 mirror. We validate the concept in an actual datacenter network with a new security application that can detect and mitigate real-world dDoS attacks, with lags from 430 us up to 3 ms - several orders of magnitude faster than before. © 2017 IFIP.},

abstract={Context: Bug reports record issues found during software development and maintenance. A high-impact bug report (HBR) describes an issue that can cause severe damage once occurred after deployment. Identifying HBRs from the bug repository as early as possible is crucial for guaranteeing software quality. Objective: In recent years, many machine learning-based approaches have been proposed for HBR prediction, and most of them are based on supervised machine learning. However, the assumption of supervised machine learning is that it needs a large number of labeled data, which is often difficult to gather in practice. Method: In this paper, we propose hbrPredictor, which combines interactive machine learning and active learning to HBR prediction. On the one hand, it can dramatically reduce the number of bug reports required for prediction model training; on the other hand, it improves the diversity and generalization ability of training samples via uncertainty sampling. Result: We take security bug report (SBR) prediction as an example of HBR prediction and perform a large-scale experimental evaluation on datasets from different open-source projects. The results show: (1) hbrPredictor substantially outperforms the two baselines and obtains the maximum values of F1-score (0.7939) and AUC (0.8789); (2) with the dynamic stop criteria, hbrPredictor could reach its best performance with only 45% and 13% of the total bug reports for small-sized datasets and large-sized datasets, respectively. Conclusion: By reducing the number of required training samples, hbrPredictor could substantially save the data labeling effort without decreasing the effectiveness of the model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play a vital role in the modern cyber-security system. The main task of an IDS is to distinguish between benign and malicious network flows. Hence, the researchers and practitioners usually utilize the power of machine learning techniques by considering an IDS as a binary-classifier. Recent research works demonstrate that an ensemble learning algorithm like xgboost can achieve almost perfect classification in the offline configuration. On the other hand, the performance of a simple and lightweight classification algorithm like Naive Bayes can be improved significantly if we can select a proper sub-training set. In this paper, we discuss the usage of active learning in online configuration to reduce the labeling cost but maintaining the classification performance. We evaluate our approach using the popular real-world datasets and showed that our approach outperformed state-of-the-art results. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Various papers on cyberwarfare in virtual environments and cybersecurity in intelligent systems have been published. Work has focused on the integration of cyberwarfare communication effects into a live–virtual–constructive (LVC) environment in order to better represent a network centric battlespace subject to cyber-attack, at a large force level. In addition, virtual cyber ranges have been developed. A virtual cyber range is a portable modeling and simulation framework that provides a real-time, hardware-in-the-loop capability for simulation of cyber threats to the entire net-centric infrastructure. The framework enables interoperability with LVC simulations, providing training and assessment of human-in-the-loop performance. This work builds on previous work and shows the need for a framework to support the modeling and simulation of cyber-attack and defense for training and assessment. This work does focus on cybersecurity for wireless communications, but the focus is on large network-centric systems at force level. Furthermore, there are published descriptions of research focused on the use of multi-agent systems in vehicle-to-vehicle communication and autonomous driving systems, such as Google’s driverless car. While the vehicles are commercial by nature, there are many similarities to military autonomous vehicles (MAVs), in their system components and architecture as well as the cybersecurity threats that they face. While these works are related to the work presented in this paper, with their focus on synthetic environments and commercial autonomous systems, they are not closely related. The focus of this paper is on small point to point and point to multipoint wireless networks, comprised of only a few nodes, with the nodes representing MAVs and controllers. The US Army, Air Force, and Navy are continuing to increase their use of these systems, and are now focusing on cybersecurity. Due to the lagging focus on wireless networks and autonomous vehicles, there is not much published work that is related. Current unmanned systems were not built with cybersecurity considerations taken into account, and are thus vulnerable to cyber-attack. The objective of this paper is to present and describe the need for a cyber-attack and defense simulation framework to support the modeling and simulation for cybersecurity of autonomous vehicle systems used by US Armed Forces. These autonomous vehicle systems include unmanned aerial systems and unmanned ground systems. The paper describes a notional framework to support this type of modeling, as well as a detailed use case and example cyber-attack simulation system. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={The digitization of manufacturing industry has led to leaner and more efficient production, under the Industry 4.0 concept. Nowadays, datasets collected from shop floor assets and information technology (IT) systems are used in data-driven analytics efforts to support more informed business intelligence decisions. However, these results are currently only used in isolated and dispersed parts of the production process. At the same time, full integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in all parts of manufacturing systems is currently lacking. In this context, the goal of this manuscript is to present a more holistic integration of AI by promoting collaboration. To this end, collaboration is understood as a multi-dimensional conceptual term that covers all important enablers for AI adoption in manufacturing contexts and is promoted in terms of business intelligence optimization, human-in-the-loop and secure federation across manufacturing sites. To address these challenges, the proposed architectural approach builds on three technical pillars: (1) components that extend the functionality of the existing layers in the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0; (2) definition of new layers for collaboration by means of human-in-the-loop and federation; (3) security concerns with AI-powered mechanisms. In addition, system implementation aspects are discussed and potential applications in industrial environments, as well as business impacts, are presented. © 2020, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Machine learning has been applied to a broad range of applications and some of them are available online as application programming interfaces (APIs) with either free (trial) or paid subscriptions. In this paper, we study adversarial machine learning in the form of back-box attacks on online classifier APIs. We start with a deep learning based exploratory (inference) attack, which aims to build a classifier that can provide similar classification results (labels) as the target classifier. To minimize the difference between the labels returned by the inferred classifier and the target classifier, we show that the deep learning based exploratory attack requires a large number of labeled training data samples. These labels can be collected by calling the online API, but usually there is some strict rate limitation on the number of allowed API calls. To mitigate the impact of limited training data, we develop an active learning approach that first builds a classifier based on a small number of API calls and uses this classifier to select samples to further collect their labels. Then, a new classifier is built using more training data samples. This updating process can be repeated multiple times. We show that this active learning approach can build an adversarial classifier with a small statistical difference from the target classifier using only a limited number of training data samples. We further consider evasion and causative (poisoning) attacks based on the inferred classifier that is built by the exploratory attack. Evasion attack determines samples that the target classifier is likely to misclassify, whereas causative attack provides erroneous training data samples to reduce the reliability of the re-trained classifier. The success of these attacks show that adversarial machine learning emerges as a feasible threat in the realistic case with limited training data. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Policing of road traffic is listed in the most hazardous tasks since many traffic police personnel injured in a series of accidents at intersections. A life-size traffic cop robot called 'IWI' is invented as an alternative to human traffic police in the street for directing traffic on point duty, and this paper proposes a human-robot cooperation scheme with wearable augmented glasses as an HMI to obtain a more immersing teleoperation experience with the aid of wearable augmented reality glasses. First, a humanoid robot is tailored for mobile surveillance with raspberry pi camera based eyes and omnidirectional Mecanum wheels. Second, the real-time video stream acquired by the on-site robot is distributed to multiple terminals, such as the central sever, the wearable augmented reality glasses and the mobile control tablet. Third, with a depth of focus estimation the augmented indications are displayed to aid to understand the remote scenario. Finally, the human policing results, such as STOP, PULL OVER, TURN-LEFT, are compiled and programmed as simplified patterns to control the robot body/hand pantomime. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology and control scheme is feasible in real-time application with high real-time performance of less than 0.5s latency, and open possibilities of easing the traffic jam via simultaneously scheduling multiple traffic cop robots. © 2017 IEEE.},

Smart Home involves IoT-based automation (such as smart lighting, heating, surveillance etc.), remote monitoring and control of smart appliances. Besides automation, human-in-the-loop is a unique characteristic of Smart home to offer personalized services. Understanding the human behavior requires context processing. Thus, enablement of Smart home involves two prominent technologies IoT and context-aware computing. Further, local devices lying in the smart home have the implicit location and situational information, hence fog computing can offer real-time smart home services. In this paper, the authors propose ICON (IoT-based CONtext-aware) framework for context-aware IoT applications such as smart home, further ICON leverages fog-based IoT middleware to perform context-aware processing.

abstract={Cyber threat intelligence and security informatics play critical roles in the identification of the principal influencers and threats associated with criminal activity and extremism in web-based communities. This paper presents an effective, dynamic learning framework utilizing domain specific context information to design a novel classification model that can robustly identify malicious social media posts (e.g. enrollment propaganda for extremist groups) with expressions of extremism or criminal intent. Research towards automated identification of extreme online posts and their associated key suspects and threats faces numerous challenges, 1) Online data, particularly social media data, originated from numerous independent and heterogeneous sources are largely unstructured. 2) The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of criminal activity and extremism are constantly evolving. 3) There are limited ground truth data to support the development of effective classification technologies. In this paper, we present a human-machine collaborative, semi-supervised learning system that can efficiently and effectively identify malicious social media posts in presence of these challenges. Our system and framework develops an initial classifier from limited annotated data and in an interactive manner evolves dynamically into a sophisticated model using shortlisted relevant samples, identified via a graph-based optimization method, solvable by maximum flow algorithm. This same method also may be used to refine the classifier as TTPs evolve. Under this framework, the classifier performance converges faster using roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer annotated samples, as compared to fully supervised solutions, resulting in a reasonably acceptable accuracy of nearly 80%. We validate our framework using a large collection of English and non-English flagged words extracted from three web-based forums and manually verified by multiple independent annotators. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid development of malicious software programs has posed severe threats to Computer and Internet security. Therefore, it motivates anti-malware vendors and researchers to develop novel methods which are capable of protecting users against new threats. Existing malware detectors mostly treat the file samples separately using supervised learning algorithms. However, ignoring the relationship among file samples limits the capability of malware detectors. In this paper, based on the file-to-file social network, we present a new malware detection framework, FindMal(File-to-File Social Network based Malware Detection Framework), including graph-based features extraction, Label Propagation algorithm, and active learning strategy. Nearest neighbors are first chosen as adjacent nodes for each file node to construct kNN file relation graph. Three file relation graph features are proposed to sample the representative file samples for labeling. Then, Label Propagation algorithm, which propagates the label information from labeled file samples to unlabeled files, is applied to learn the probability that one unknown file is classified as malicious or benign. A batch mode active learning method is employed to reduce the labeling cost and improve the performance of Label Propagation. Comprehensive experiments on real and large scale dataset obtained from an anti-malware company are performed. The results demonstrate that our proposed FindMal outperforms other existing detection models in classifying file samples. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A growing number of applications, e.g., video surveillance and medical image analysis, require training recognition systems from large amounts of weakly annotated data, while some targeted interactions with a domain expert are allowed to improve the training process. In such cases, active learning (AL) can reduce labeling costs for training a classifier by querying the expert to provide the labels of most informative instances. This paper focuses on AL methods for instance classification problems in multiple instance learning (MIL), where data are arranged into sets, called bags, which are weakly labeled. Most AL methods focus on single-instance learning problems. These methods are not suitable for MIL problems because they cannot account for the bag structure of data. In this paper, new methods for bag-level aggregation of instance informativeness are proposed for multiple instance AL (MIAL). The aggregated informativeness method identifies the most informative instances based on classifier uncertainty and queries bags incorporating the most information. The other proposed method, called cluster-based aggregative sampling, clusters data hierarchically in the instance space. The informativeness of instances is assessed by considering bag labels, inferred instance labels, and the proportion of labels that remain to be discovered in clusters. Both proposed methods significantly outperform reference methods in extensive experiments using benchmark data from several application domains. Results indicate that using an appropriate strategy to address MIAL problems yields a significant reduction in the number of queries needed to achieve the same level of performance as single-instance AL methods. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Business and government operations generate large volumes of documents to be categorized through machine learning techniques before dissemination and storage. One prerequisite in such classification is to properly choose training documents. Active learning emerges as a technique to achieve better accuracy with fewer training documents by choosing data to learn and querying oracles for unknown labels. In practice, such oracles are usually human analysts who are likely to make mistakes or, in some cases, even intentionally introduce erroneous labels for malicious purposes. We propose a risk-factor based strategy to defend active-learning-based document classification against human mistakes or adversarial inputs. We show that the proposed strategy can substantially alleviate the damage caused by malicious labeling. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense strategy in terms of maintaining accuracy against adversaries. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The integration of humans into smart buildings raises challenges between meeting individual preferences and the generic rules set to optimize energy effectiveness of interest to organizations. Merging the individual preferences of multiple occupants that share thermal zones compounds the challenge. To address related challenges, we have developed FRODO (Fog Architecture for Decision Support in Organizations), an architecture designed to establish a location-aware environment for conflict negotiation and decision support that is based on fog computing. This paper describes the model transformation from a centralized software architecture towards a decentralized Cyber-Physical System (CPS) which encompasses sensors, actuators, and the occupants of smart buildings. The transformation is implemented through MIBO, a framework that allows occupants to control their environment. MIBO has been extended to introduce a fog layer for improved negotiation and conflict resolution. This enables additional benefits to be optimized, such as increased quality of service, reduced latency and improved security and resilience. The fog layer, introduced with FRODO, allows occupants and organizations to express and discuss conflicts in decision-making, at their point of origin. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={We propose an image stream mining method in which images arrive with contexts (metadata) and need to be processed in real time by the image mining system (IMS), which needs to make predictions and derive actionable intelligence from these streams. After extracting the features of the image by preprocessing, IMS determines online the classifier to use on the extracted features to make a prediction using the context of the image. A key challenge associated with stream mining is that the prediction accuracy of the classifiers is unknown, since the image source is unknown; thus, these accuracies need to be learned online. Another key challenge of stream mining is that learning can only be done by observing the true label, but this is costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we model the image stream mining problem as an active, online contextual experts problem, where the context of the image is used to guide the classifier selection decision. We develop an active learning algorithm and show that it achieves regret sublinear in the number of images that have been observed so far. To further illustrate and assess the performance of our proposed methods, we apply them to diagnose breast cancer from the images of cellular samples obtained from the fine needle aspirate of breast mass. Our findings show that very high diagnosis accuracy can be achieved by actively obtaining only a small fraction of true labels through surgical biopsies. Other applications include video surveillance and video traffic monitoring. © 1992-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Security Operation Centers rely on data triage to identify the true 'signals' from a large volume of noisy alerts and 'connect the dots' to answer certain higher-level questions about the attack activities. This work aims to automatically generate data triage automatons directly from cybersecurity analysts' operation traces. Existing methods for generating data triage automatons, including Security Information and Event Management systems (SIEMs), require event correlation rules to be generated by dedicated manual effort from expert analysts. To save analysts' workloads, we propose to 'mine' data triage rules out of cybersecurity analysts' operation traces and to use these rules to construct data triage automatons. Our approach may make the cost (of data triage automaton generation) orders of magnitudes smaller. We have designed and implemented the new system and evaluated it through a human-in-the-loop case study. The case study shows that our system can use the analysts' operation traces as input and automatically generate a corresponding state machine for data triage. The operation traces were collected in our previous lab experiment. 29 professional cybersecurity analysts were recruited to analyze a set of IDS alerts and firewall logs. False positive and false negative rates were calculated to evaluate the performance of the data triage state machine by comparing with the ground truth. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a demo of our Security Toolbox to detect novel malware in Android apps. This Toolbox is developed through our recent research project funded by the DARPA Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project. The adversarial challenge ('Red') teams in the DARPA APAC program are tasked with designing sophisticated malware to test the bounds of malware detection technology being developed by the research and development ('Blue') teams. Our research group, a Blue team in the DARPA APAC program, proposed a 'human-in-the-loop program analysis' approach to detect malware given the source or Java bytecode for an Android app. Our malware detection apparatus consists of two components: a general-purpose program analysis platform called Atlas, and a Security Toolbox built on the Atlas platform. This paper describes the major design goals, the Toolbox components to achieve the goals, and the workflow for auditing Android apps. The accompanying video illustrates features of the Toolbox through a live audit. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={With the current massive amount of traffic that is going through the internet, internet service providers (ISPs) and networking service providers (NSPs) are looking for various ways to accurately predict the application type of flow that is going through the internet. Such prediction is critical for security and network monitoring applications as they require application type to be known in prior. Traditional ways using port-based or payload-based analysis are not sufficient anymore as many applications start using dynamic unknown port numbers, masquerading, and encryption techniques to avoid being detected. Recently, machine learning has gained significant attention in many prediction applications including traffic classification from flow features or characteristics. However, such algorithms suffer from an imbalanced data problem where some applications have fewer flow data and hence difficult to predict. In this paper, we employ network flow-level characteristics to identify the application type of traffic. Furthermore, we propose the use of an improved support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, named cost-sensitive SVM (CMSVM), to solve the imbalance problem in network traffic identification. CMSVM adopts a multi-class SVM algorithm with active learning which dynamically assigns a weight for applications. We examine the classification accuracy and performance of the CMSVM algorithm using two different datasets, namely MOORE_SET and NOC_SET datasets. Our results show that the CMSVM algorithm can reduce computation cost, improve classification accuracy and solve the imbalance problem when compared to other machine learning techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Unmanned systems, with and without a human-in-the loop, are being deployed in a range of military and civilian applications spanning air, ground, sea-surface and undersea environments. Large investments, particularly in robotics, electronic miniaturization, sensors, network communication, information technology and artificial intelligence are likely to further accelerate this trend. The operation of unmanned systems, and of applications that use these systems, are heavily dependent on cyber systems that are used to collect, store, process and communicate data, making data a critical resource. At the same time, undesirable elements of our society and adversarial states have also realized the high value of this resource. While enormous efforts have been made to secure data and cyber systems, lack of rigorous threat modeling and risk analysis can lead to more specific, rather than generic, security solutions relevant to the cyber system to be protected. This scenario has created an urgent need to develop a holistic process for protecting data and cyber systems. This paper deals with the development of different pieces of this process. We first identify the security requirements of unmanned autonomous systems, and follow this up with modeling how attacks achieve their objectives. We argue that a large number of threats that can materialize as attacks and the costs of managing these attacks in cost effective ways require ranking threats using cyber threat modeling and cyber risk analysis techniques. The last segment of the paper describes a structured approach to mitigate high-risk threats. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Cybersecurity competitions are an effective and engaging way to provide students with hands-on experience with real-world security practices. Unfortunately, existing competitions are ill-suited in giving students experience in penetration testing, because they tend to lack three key aspects: (1) pivoting across multiple machines, (2) developing or implanting custom software, and (3) giving students enough time to prepare for a lively in-class competition. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and an initial run of King of the Hill (KotH), an active learning cybersecurity competition designed to give students experience performing and defending against penetration testing. KotH competitions involve a sophisticated network topology that students must pivot through in order to reach high-value targets. When teams take control of a machine, they also take on the responsibility of running its critical services and defending it against other teams. Our preliminary results indicate that KotH gives students valuable and effective first-hand experience with problems that professional penetration testers and network administrators face in real environments. © ASE 2018 - 2018 USENIX Workshop on Advances in Security Education, co-located with USENIX Security 2018.

abstract={The increasing popularity of Android phones and its open app market system have caused the proliferation of malicious Android apps. The increasing sophistication and diversity of the malicious Android apps render the conventional malware detection techniques ineffective, which results in a large number of malicious applications remaining undetected. This calls for more effective techniques for detection and classification of Android malware. Hence, in this paper, we present an Android malicious application detection framework based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Active Learning technologies. In our approach, we extract applications' activities while in execution and map them into a feature set, we then attach timestamps to some features in the set. We show that our novel use of time-dependent behavior tracking can significantly improve the malware detection accuracy. In particular, we build an active learning model using Expected error reduction query strategy to integrate new informative instances of Android malware and retrain the model to be able to do adaptive online learning. We evaluate our model through a set of experiments on the DREBIN benchmark malware dataset. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach can accurately detect malicious applications and improve updatability against new malware. © 2017 IFIP.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel tandem human-machine cognition approach for human-in-the-loop control of complex business-critical and mission-critical systems and processes that are monitored by Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor networks and where it is of utmost importance to mitigate and avoid cognitive overload situations for the human operators. The approach is based on a decision making supervisory loop for situation awareness and control combined with a machine learning technique that is especially well suited to this control problem. The goal is to achieve a number of functional requirements: (1) ultra-low false alarm probabilities for all monitored transducers, components, machines, systems, and processes; (2) fastest mathematically possible decisions regarding the incipience or onset of anomalies in noisy process metrics; and (3) the ability to unambiguously differentiate between sensor degradation events and degradation in the systems/processes under surveillance. The novel approach that is presented here does not replace the role of the human in operation of complex engineering systems and processes, but rather augments that role in a manner that minimizes cognitive overload by very rapidly processing, interpreting, and displaying final diagnostic and prognostic information to the human operator in a prioritized format that is readily perceived and comprehended. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems, medical diagnosis, network security, etc., require on-going learning and decision-making in real time. These - and many others - represent perfect examples of the opportunities and difficulties presented by Big Data: the available information often arrives from a variety of sources and has diverse features so that learning from all the sources may be valuable but integrating what is learned is subject to the curse of dimensionality. This paper develops and analyzes algorithms that allow efficient learning and decision-making while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We formalize the information available to the learner/decision-maker at a particular time as a context vector which the learner should consider when taking actions. In general the context vector is very high dimensional, but in many settings, the most relevant information is embedded into only a few relevant dimensions. If these relevant dimensions were known in advance, the problem would be simple - but they are not. Moreover, the relevant dimensions may be different for different actions. Our algorithm learns the relevant dimensions for each action, and makes decisions based in what it has learned. Formally, we build on the structure of a contextual multi-armed bandit by adding and exploiting a relevance relation. We prove a general regret bound for our algorithm whose time order depends only on the maximum number of relevant dimensions among all the actions, which in the special case where the relevance relation is single-valued (a function), reduces to Õ(T2(2√-1)); in the absence of a relevance relation, the best known contextual bandit algorithms achieve regret Õ(T(D+1)/(D+2)), where D is the full dimension of the context vector. Our algorithm alternates between exploring and exploiting and does not require observing outcomes during exploitation (so allows for active learning). Moreover, during exploitation, suboptimal actions are chosen with arbitrarily low probability. Our algorithm is tested on datasets arising from network security and online news article recommendations. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Network traffic classification to detect DDoS attacks is challenging in the context of high-speed networks. In this paper, we discuss the need for distributed feature selection in intrusion detection systems using parallel computing. This paper presents a parallel cumulative ranker algorithm to rank the attributes of a dataset for cost-effective classification of network traffic. We use MIT-DARPA, CAIDA, ISCX-IDS and TU-DDoS datasets to validate our method. Our feature ranking algorithm on large datasets (50,000-1,000,000 instances) finds best possible features from the above mentioned datasets and gives high accuracy (92%-97%) in a parallel environment, which takes significantly less time (71%-85% lower) than a sequential environment. We also discuss the importance of active learning to select appropriate instances by an expert module in an unsupervised way to train an SVM binary classifier for detection of DDoS attack traffic. Our approach selects small batches of training samples from a dataset to yield classification of network traffic with high accuracy. Our approach on large data provides better accuracy in classification with fewer training samples. A case study looks into the detection of intrusion in power systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the proliferation of the internet and increased global access to online media, cybercrime is also occurring at an increasing rate. Currently, both personal users and companies are vulnerable to cybercrime. A number of tools including firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be used as defense mechanisms. A firewall acts as a checkpoint which allows packets to pass through according to predetermined conditions. In extreme cases, it may even disconnect all network traffic. An IDS, on the other hand, automates the monitoring process in computer networks. The streaming nature of data in computer networks poses a significant challenge in building IDS. In this paper, a method is proposed to overcome this problem by performing online classification on datasets. In doing so, an incremental naive Bayesian classifier is employed. Furthermore, active learning enables solving the problem using a small set of labeled data points which are often very expensive to acquire. The proposed method includes two groups of actions i.e. offline and online. The former involves data preprocessing while the latter introduces the NADAL online method. The proposed method is compared to the incremental naive Bayesian classifier using the NSL-KDD standard dataset. There are three advantages with the proposed method: (1) overcoming the streaming data challenge; (2) reducing the high cost associated with instance labeling; and (3) improved accuracy and Kappa compared to the incremental naive Bayesian approach. Thus, the method is well-suited to IDS applications. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={A former definition states that a brain-computer Interface provides a direct communication channel to the brain without the need for muscles and nerves. With the emergence of wearable and wireless brain-computer interfaces, these systems have evolved to become part of wireless body area networks, offering people-centric applications such as cognitive workload assessment and detection of selective attention. Currently, wireless body area networks are mostly integrated by low-cost devices that, because of their limited hardware resources, cannot generate secure random numbers for encryption. This is a critical issue in the context of new Internet of Things device communication and its security. Such devices require securing their communication, mostly by means of the automatic renewal of the cryptographic keys. In the domain of the people-centric Internet of Things, we propose to use wireless brain-computer interfaces as a secure source of entropy, based on neuro-Activity, capable to generate secure keys that outperforms other generation methods. In our approach, current wireless brain-computer interface technology is an attractive option to offer novel services emerged from novel necessities in the context of the people-centric Internet of Things. Our proposal is an implementation of the human-in-The-loop paradigm, in which devices and humans indistinctly request and offer services to each other for mutual benefit. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The advancing of reverse engineering techniques has complicated the efforts in intellectual property protection. Proactive methods have been developed recently, among which layout-level integrated circuit camouflaging is the leading example. However, existing camouflaging methods are rarely supported by provably secure criteria, which further leads to an over-estimation of the security level when countering latest de-camouflaging attacks, e.g., the SAT-based attack. In this paper, a quantitative security criterion is proposed for de-camouflaging complexity measurements and formally analyzed through the demonstration of the equivalence between the existing de-camouflaging strategy and the active learning scheme. Supported by the new security criterion, two camouflaging techniques are proposed, including the low-overhead camouflaging cell generation strategy and the AND-tree camouflaging strategy, to help achieve exponentially increasing security levels at the cost of linearly increasing performance overhead on the circuit under protection. A provably secure camouflaging framework is then developed combining these two techniques. The experimental results using the security criterion show that camouflaged circuits with the proposed framework are of high resilience against different attack schemes with only negligible performance overhead. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Malware is 'malicious software' programs that carry out many of the cyberattacks on the Internet, including cybercrime, fraud, scams and nation-state cyberwar. These malicious software programs come in a wide range of different classifications such as viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, botnet malware, ransomware, Rootkit, etc. Ransomware is class of malware that holds the victim's data hostage by encrypting the data on a user's computer to make it unavailable to the user and only decrypt it after the user pays a ransom in the form of a sum of money. To avoid detection, different variants of ransomware utilise one or more techniques in their attack flow including Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. There is, therefore, a need to understand the techniques used ransomware development and their deployment strategy in order to understand their attack flow better to develop appropriate countermeasures. In this paper, we propose DNAact-Ran, A Digital DNA Sequencing Engine for Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning. DNAact-Ran utilises Digital DNA sequencing design constraints and k-mer frequency vector. To measure the efficacy of the proposed approach, we evaluated DNAact-Run on 582 ransomware and 942 goodware instances to measure the performance of precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy. Compared to other methods, the evaluation results show that DNAact-Run can predict and detect ransomware accurately and effectively. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Food security is one of the societal challenge topics. As one-third of all food consumed by humans relies on animal pollination currently, this research provides an emerging solution to food supply reduction caused by population shrinking of natural pollinators, so as to reduce its impact on ecological relationships, ecosystem conservation and stability, genetic variation in the crop plant community, floral diversity, specialisation and evolution. This paper develops a conceptual technical roadmap of autonomous pollination for future farming using robotic micro air vehicle pollinators (MPrs). The research provides new insights into autonomous design and manufacture and into possible ways to increase the production efficiency which shortens the time from lab to market. The autonomous MPrs are realized using artificial intelligence and human expertise in the loop for smart agricultural industry.

abstract={The area of the Internet of Things is growing rapidly. The volume of transmitted data over the various sensors is growing accordingly. Sensors typically are low in resources of storage, memory and processing power. Data security and privacy are part of the major concerns and drawbacks of this growing domain. Sensor traffic analysis has become an increasingly important domain to protect IoT infrastructures from intruders. An IoT network intrusion detection system is required to monitor and analyze the traffic and predict possible attacks. Machine leaning techniques can automatically extract normal and abnormal patterns from a large set of training sensors data. Due to the high volume of traffic and the need for real-time reaction, accurate threat discovery is mandatory. This work focuses on designing a lightweight comprehensive IoT rules generation and execution framework. It is composed of three components, a machine learning rule discovery, a threat prediction model builder and tools to ensure timely reaction to rules violation and un-standardized and ongoing changes in traffic behavior. The generated detection model is expected to identify in real-time exceptions and notify the system accordingly. We use Random-Forest (RF) as the machine learning platform for rules discovery and real-time anomaly detection. To allow RF adaptation to IoT we propose several improvements to make it lightweight and propose a process that combines IoT network capabilities; messaging and resource sharing, to build a comprehensive and efficient IoT security framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Neural Network (NN) accelerators are currently widely deployed in various security-crucial scenarios, including image recognition, natural language processing and autonomous vehicles. Due to economic and privacy concerns, the hardware implementations of structures and designs inside NN accelerators are usually inaccessible to the public. However, these accelerators still tend to leak crucial information through Electromagnetic (EM) side channels in addition to timing and power information. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient model stealing attack against current popular large-scale NN accelerators deployed on hardware platforms through side-channel information. Specifically, the proposed attack approach contains two stages: 1) Inferring the underlying network architecture through EM sidechannel information; 2) Estimating the parameters, especially the weights, through a margin-based, adversarial active learning method. The experimental results show that the proposed attack approach can accurately recover the large-scale NN through EM side-channel information leakages. Overall, our attack highlights the importance of masking EM traces for large-scale NN accelerators in real-world applications. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current scenario, it is significant to design active learning paradigms for analyzing human activities using Wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT) sensors for health parameter analysis. Further, in the healthcare sector, data collection using decision-making tools uses wearable sensors for monitoring using Cloud assisted Internet of Things (IoT). Although several conventional algorithms and deep learning models show promising results in sensor data analysis for recognizing human behaviors, the evaluation of their ambiguity in decision-making is still difficult and several conventional systems are more complex. Due to the restricted computing capacity, low-power W-IoT devices need an optimized network to manage the healthcare data effectively and efficiently for reliable analysis. Hence, a new Human Activity Recognition based on Improved Bayesian Convolution Network (IBCN)has been proposed which allows each smart system to download data via either traditional Radio Frequency (RF) communication or low power back dispersion communications with cloud assistance. In IBCN, A distribution of the model's latent variable is designed and the features are extracted using convolution layers, the performance of the W-IoT has been improved by combining a variable autoencoder with a standard deep net classifier. Furthermore, the Bayesian network helps to address the security issues using Enhanced deep learning (EDL) design with an effective offloading strategy. The experimental results show that the data collected from the wearable IoT sensor is sensitive to various sources of uncertainty, i.e. aleatoric and epistemic, as especially named noise and reliability. Furthermore, lab-scale experimental analysis on patient's health data classification accuracy has been considerably developed using IBCN than conventional design as namedCognitive radio (CR) learning, deep learning-based sensor activity recognition (DL-SAR) and Cloud-assisted Agent-based Smart home Environment (CASE). © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The private insurance sector is recognized as one of the fastest-growing industries. This rapid growth has fueled incredible transformations over the past decade. Nowadays, there exist insurance products for most high-value assets such as vehicles, jewellery, health/life, and homes. Insurance companies are at the forefront in adopting cutting-edge operations, processes, and mathematical models to maximize profit whilst servicing their customers claims. Traditional methods that are exclusively based on human-in-the-loop models are very time-consuming and inaccurate. In this paper, we develop a secure and automated insurance system framework that reduces human interaction, secures the insurance activities, alerts and informs about risky customers, detects fraudulent claims, and reduces monetary loss for the insurance sector. After presenting the blockchain-based framework to enable secure transactions and data sharing among different interacting agents within the insurance network, we propose to employ the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm for the aforementioned insurance services and compare its performances with those of other state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained results reveal that, when applied to an auto insurance dataset, the XGboost achieves high performance gains compared to other existing learning algorithms. For instance, it reaches 7% higher accuracy compared to decision tree models when detecting fraudulent claims. The obtained results reveal that, when applied to an auto insurance dataset, the XGboost achieves high performance gains compared to other existing learning algorithms.

Furthermore, we propose an online learning solution to automatically deal with real-time updates of the insurance network and we show that it outperforms another online state-of-the-art algorithm.

abstract={Real-world systems change continuously. In domains such as traffic monitoring or cyber security, such changes occur within short time scales. This results in a streaming data problem and leads to unique challenges for the human in the loop, as analysts have to ingest and make sense of dynamic patterns in real time. While visualizations are being increasingly used by analysts to derive insights from streaming data, we lack a thorough characterization of the human-centred design problems and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art solutions that exist for addressing these problems. In this paper, our goal is to fill this gap by studying how the state of the art in streaming data visualization handles the challenges and reflect on the gaps and opportunities. To this end, we have three contributions in this paper: (i) problem characterization for identifying domain-specific goals and challenges for handling streaming data, (ii) a survey and analysis of the state of the art in streaming data visualization research with a focus on how visualization design meets challenges specific to change perception and (iii) reflections on the design trade-offs, and an outline of potential research directions for addressing the gaps in the state of the art. © 2017 The Authors and 2017 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={We discuss the challenge of managing the Multifunction Phased Array Radar (MPAR) timeline to satisfy the requirements of its multiple missions, with a particular focus on weather surveillance. This command and control (C2) function partitions the available scan time among these missions, exploits opportunities to service multiple missions simultaneously, and utilizes techniques for increasing scan rate where feasible. After reviewing the candidate MPAR architectures and relevant previous research, we describe a specific C2 framework that is consistent with a demonstrated active array architecture using overlapped subarrays to realize multiple, concurrent receive beams. Analysis of recently articulated requirements for near-airport and national-scale aircraft surveillance indicates that with this architecture, 40-60% of the MPAR scan timeline would be available for the high-fidelity weather observations currently provided by the Weather Service Radar (WSR-88D) network. We show that an appropriate use of subarray generated concurrent receive beams, in concert with previously documented, complementary techniques to increase the weather scan rate, could enable MPAR to perform full weather volume scans at a rate of 1 per minute. Published observing system simulation experiments, human-in-the-loop studies and radar-data assimilation experiments indicate that high-quality weather radar observations at this rate may significantly improve the lead time and reliability of severe weather warnings relative to current observation capabilities. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber attacks have become a problem that is threatening the economy, human privacy, and even national security. Before we can adequately address the problem, we need to have a crystal clear understanding about cyber attacks from various perspectives. This is a challenge because the Internet is a large-scale complex system with humans in the loop. In this paper, we investigate a particular perspective of the problem, namely the extreme value phenomenon that is exhibited by cyber attack rates, which are the numbers of attacks against a system of interest per time unit. It is important to explore this perspective because understanding the statistical properties of extreme cyber attack rates will pave the way for cost-effective, if not optimal, allocation of resources in real-life cyber defense operations. Specifically, we propose modeling and predicting extreme cyber attack rates via marked point processes, while using the Value-at-Risk as a natural measure of intense cyber attacks. The point processes are then applied to analyze some real data sets. Our analysis shows that the point processes can describe and predict extreme cyber attack rates at a very satisfactory accuracy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={We tackle the problem of analyzing filter and sanitizer programs remotely, i.e. given only the ability to query the targeted program and observe the output. We focus on two important and widely used program classes: regular expression (RE) filters and string sanitizers. We demonstrate that existing tools from machine learning that are available for analyzing RE filters, namely automata learning algorithms, require a very large number of queries in order to infer real life RE filters. Motivated by this, we develop the first algorithm that infers symbolic representations of automata in the standard membership/equivalence query model. We show that our algorithm provides an improvement of x15 times in the number of queries required to learn real life XSS and SQL filters of popular web application firewall systems such as mod-security and PHPIDS. % Active learning algorithms require the usage of an equivalence oracle, i.e. an oracle that tests the equivalence of a hypothesis with the target machine. We show that when the goal is to audit a target filter with respect to a set of attack strings from a context free grammar, i.e. find an attack or infer that none exists, we can use the attack grammar to implement the equivalence oracle with a single query to the filter. Our construction finds on average 90% of the target filter states when no attack exists and is very effective in finding attacks when they are present. For the case of string sanitizers, we show that existing algorithms for inferring sanitizers modelled as Mealy Machines are not only inefficient, but lack the expressive power to be able to infer real life sanitizers. We design two novel extensions to existing algorithms that allow one to infer sanitizers represented as single-valued transducers. Our algorithms are able to infer many common sanitizer functions such as HTML encoders and decoders. Furthermore, we design an algorithm to convert the inferred models into BEK programs, which allows for further applications such as cross checking different sanitizer implementations and cross compiling sanitizers into different languages supported by the BEK backend. We showcase the power of our techniques by utilizing our black-box inference algorithms to perform an equivalence checking between different HTML encoders including the encoders from Twitter, Facebook and Microsoft Outlook email, for which no implementation is publicly available. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates Online Active Learning (OAL) for imbalanced unlabeled datastream, where only a budget of labels can be queried to optimize some cost-sensitive performance measure. OAL can solve many real-world problems, such as anomaly detection in healthcare, finance and network security. In these problems, there are two key challenges: the query budget is often limited; the ratio between two classes is highly imbalanced. To address these challenges, existing work of OAL adopts either asymmetric losses or queries (an isolated asymmetric strategy) to tackle the imbalance, and uses first-order methods to optimize the cost-sensitive measure. However, they may incur two deficiencies: (1) the poor ability in handling imbalanced data due to the isolated asymmetric strategy; (2) relative slow convergence rate due to the first-order optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel Online Adaptive Asymmetric Active (OA3) learning algorithm, which is based on a new asymmetric strategy (merging both the asymmetric losses and queries strategies), and second-order optimization. We theoretically analyze its bounds, and also empirically evaluate it on four real-world online anomaly detection tasks. Promising results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in various application domains. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Rare category identification is an important task in many application domains, ranging from network security, to financial fraud detection, to personalized medicine. These are all applications which require the discovery and characterization of sets of rare but structurally-similar data entities which are obscured within a larger but structurally different dataset. This paper introduces RCLens, a visual analytics system designed to support user-guided rare category exploration and identification. RCLens adopts a novel active learning-based algorithm to iteratively identify more accurate rare categories in response to user-provided feedback. The algorithm is tightly integrated with an interactive visualization-based interface which supports a novel and effective workflow for rare category identification. This paper (1) defines RCLens' underlying active-learning algorithm; (2) describes the visualization and interaction designs, including a discussion of how the designs support user-guided rare category identification; and (3) presents results from an evaluation demonstrating RCLens' ability to support the rare category identification process. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Classifiers operating in a dynamic, real world environment, are vulnerable to adversarial activity, which causes the data distribution to change over time. These changes are traditionally referred to as concept drift, and several approaches have been developed in literature to deal with the problem of drift detection and handling. However, most concept drift handling techniques approach it as a domain independent task, to make them applicable to a wide gamut of reactive systems. These techniques are developed from an adversarial agnostic perspective, where they naively assume that adversarial activity is like any other change to the data, which can be fixed by retraining the models. However, this is not the case when a malicious agent is trying to evade the deployed classification system. In such an environment, the properties of concept drift are unique, as the drift is intended to degrade the system and at the same time designed to avoid detection by traditional concept drift detection techniques. This special category of drift is termed as adversarial drift, and this paper analyzes its characteristics and impact in a streaming environment. A novel framework for dealing with adversarial concept drift is proposed, called the Predict-Detect streaming framework. This framework uses adversarial forethought and incorporates the context of classification into the drift detection task, to provide leverage in dynamic-adversarial domains. Experimental evaluation of the framework, on generated adversarial drifting data streams, demonstrates that this framework is able to provide early and reliable unsupervised indication of drift, and is able to recover from drifts swiftly. While traditional drift detectors can be evaded by intelligent adversaries, the proposed framework is especially designed to capture adversaries by misdirecting them into revealing themselves. In addition, the framework is designed to work on imbalanced and sparsely labeled data streams, as a limited-memory, incremental algorithm. The generic design and domain independent nature of the framework makes it applicable as a blueprint for developers wanting to implement reactive security to their classification based systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Many new unknown malwares aimed at compromising smartphones are created constantly. These widely used smartphones are very dependent on anti-virus solutions due to their limited resources. To update the anti-virus signature repository, anti-virus vendors must deal with vast quantities of new applications daily in order to identify new unknown malwares. Machine learning algorithms have been used to address this task, yet they must also be efficiently updated on a daily basis. To improve detection and updatability, we introduce a new framework, “ALDROID” and active learning (AL) methods on which ALDROID is based. Our methods are aimed at selecting only new informative applications (benign and especially malicious), thus reducing the labeling efforts of security experts, and enable a frequent and efficient process of enhancing the framework’s detection model and Android’s anti-virus software. Results indicate that our AL methods outperformed other solutions including the existing AL method and heuristic engine. Our AL methods acquired the largest number and percentage of new malwares, while preserving the detection models’ detection capabilities (high TPR and low FPR rates). Specifically, our methods acquired more than double the amount of new malwares acquired by the heuristic engine and 6.5 times more malwares than the existing AL method. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) classifiers have been widely deployed to detect Android malware, but at the same time the application of ML classifiers also faces an emerging problem. The performance of such classifiers degrades - -or called ages - -significantly over time given the malware evolution. Prior works have proposed to use retraining or active learning to reverse and improve aged models. However, the underlying classifier itself is still blind, unaware of malware evolution. Unsurprisingly, such evolution-insensitive retraining or active learning comes at a price, i.e., the labeling of tens of thousands of malware samples and the cost of significant human efforts. In this paper, we propose the first framework, called APIGraph, to enhance state-of-the-art malware classifiers with the similarity information among evolved Android malware in terms of semantically-equivalent or similar API usages, thus naturally slowing down classifier aging. Our evaluation shows that because of the slow-down of classifier aging, APIGraph saves significant amounts of human efforts required by active learning in labeling new malware samples. © 2020 ACM.},

In this paper, we present the design of two courses, instruction and assessment techniques, as well as our observations over the last three semesters. The students report they had a unique opportunity to deeply understand the topic and practice their soft skills, as they presented their results at a faculty open day event.

Effective methods of detecting the phishing websites are urgently needed to alleviate the threats posed by the phishing attacks. As the active learning capability from massive data sets, the neural network is widely used to detect the phishing attacks. However, in the stage of training data sets, many useless and small influence features will trap the neural network model into the problem of over-fitting. This problem usually causes the trained model that cannot effectively detect phishing websites. In order to alleviate this problem, this paper proposes OFS-NN, an effective phishing websites detection model based on the optimal feature selection method and neural network. In the proposed OFS-NN, a new index, feature validity value (FVV), is first introduced to evaluate the impact of sensitive features on the phishing websites detection. Then, based on the new FVV index, an algorithm is designed to select the optimal features from the phishing websites. This algorithm is able to alleviate the over-fitting problem of the underlying neural network to a large extent. The selected optimal features are used to train the underlying neural network, and finally, an optimal classifier is constructed to detect the phishing websites. The experimental results show that the OFS-NN model is accurate and stable in detecting many types of phishing websites. © 2013 IEEE.},

The algorithm requires little input data, specifically, a few relations or patterns (heuristics for identifying relations), and incorporates an active learning component which queries the user on the most important decisions to prevent drifting from the desired relations.

abstract={For finite document collections, continuous active learning ("CAL") has been observed to achieve high recall with high probability, at a labeling cost asymptotically proportional to the number of relevant documents. As the size of the collection increases, the number of relevant documents typically increases as well, thereby limiting the applicability of CAL to low-prevalence high-stakes classes, such as evidence in legal proceedings, or security threats, where human effort proportional to the number of relevant documents is justified. We present a scalable version of CAL ("S-CAL") that requires O(log N) labeling effort and O(N log N) computational effort - where N is the number of unlabeled training examples - to construct a classifier whose effectiveness for a given labeling cost compares favorably with previously reported methods. At the same time, S-CAL offers calibrated estimates of class prevalence, recall, and precision, facilitating both threshold setting and determination of the adequacy of the classifier. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming truly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, but it also faces unique security challenges. Intrusion detection is critical for the security and safety of a wireless IoT network. This article discusses the human-in-theloop active learning approach for wireless intrusion detection. We first present the fundamental challenges against the design of a successful intrusion detection system for a wireless IoT network. We then briefly review the rudimentary concepts of active learning and propose its employment in the diverse applications of wireless intrusion detection. An experimental example is also presented to show the significant performance improvement of the active learning method over the traditional supervised learning approach. While machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely employed for intrusion detection, the application of human-in-the-loop ML that leverages both machine and human intelligence to intrusion detection of IoT is still in its infancy. We hope this article can assist readers in understanding the key concepts of active learning and spur further research in this area. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Big sensor data provide significant potential for chemical fault diagnosis, which involves the baseline values of security, stability and reliability in chemical processes. A deep neural network (DNN) with novel active learning for inducing chemical fault diagnosis is presented in this study. It is a method using large amount of chemical sensor data, which is a combination of deep learning and active learning criterion to target the difficulty of consecutive fault diagnosis. DNN with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be developed through deep learning to learn a suitable feature representation from raw sensor data in an unsupervised manner using stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) and work through a layer-by-layer successive learning process. The features are added to the top Softmax regression layer to construct the discriminative fault characteristics for diagnosis in a supervised manner. Considering the expensive and time consuming labeling of sensor data in chemical applications, in contrast to the available methods, we employ a novel active learning criterion for the particularity of chemical processes, which is a combination of Best vs. Second Best criterion (BvSB) and a Lowest False Positive criterion (LFP), for further fine-tuning of diagnosis model in an active manner rather than passive manner. That is, we allow models to rank the most informative sensor data to be labeled for updating the DNN parameters during the interaction phase. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in two well-known industrial datasets. Results indicate that the proposed method can obtain superior diagnosis accuracy and provide significant performance improvement in accuracy and false positive rate with less labeled chemical sensor data by further active learning compared with existing methods. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our lives in many ways. One application domain is data science. New techniques in automating the creation of AI, known as AutoAI or AutoML, aim to automate the work practices of data scientists. AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={We need more skilled cybersecurity professionals because the number of cyber threats and ingenuity of attackers is ever growing.

In this paper, we present experience gained from the preparation and execution of cyber defence exercises involving various participants in a cyber range. The exercises follow a Red vs. Blue team format, in which the Red team conducts malicious activities against emulated networks and systems that have to be defended by Blue teams of learners. Although this exercise format is popular and used worldwide by numerous organizers in practice, it has been sparsely researched. We contribute to the topic by describing the general exercise life cycle, covering the exercise's development, dry run, execution, evaluation, and repetition. Each phase brings several challenges that exercise organizers have to deal with. We present lessons learned that can help organizers to prepare, run and repeat successful events systematically, with lower effort and costs, and avoid a trial-and-error approach that is often used. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The advancing of reverse engineering techniques has complicated the efforts in intellectual property protection. Proactive methods have been developed recently, among which layout-level IC camouflaging is the leading example. However, existing camouflaging methods are rarely supported by provably secure criteria, which further leads to over-estimation of the security level when countering the latest de-camouflaging attacks, e.g., the SAT-based attack. In this paper, a quantitative security criterion is proposed for de-camouflaging complexity measurements and formally analyzed through the demonstration of the equivalence between the existing de-camouflaging strategy and the active learning scheme. Supported by the new security criterion, two novel camouflaging techniques are proposed, the low-overhead camouflaging cell library and the AND-tree structure, to help achieve exponentially increasing security levels at the cost of linearly increasing performance overhead on the circuit under protection. A provably secure camouflaging framework is then developed by combining these two techniques. Experimental results using the security criterion show that the camouflaged circuits with the proposed framework are of high resilience against the SAT-based attack with negligible performance overhead. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Attackers increasingly take advantage of innocent users who tend to casually open email messages assumed to be benign, carrying malicious documents. Recent targeted attacks aimed at organizations utilize the new Microsoft Word documents (∗.docx). Anti-virus software fails to detect new unknown malicious files, including malicious docx files. In this paper, we present ALDOCX, a framework aimed at accurate detection of new unknown malicious docx files that also efficiently enhances the framework's detection capabilities over time. Detection relies upon our new structural feature extraction methodology (SFEM), which is performed statically using meta-features extracted from docx files. Using machine-learning algorithms with SFEM, we created a detection model that successfully detects new unknown malicious docx files. In addition, because it is crucial to maintain the detection model's updatability and incorporate new malicious files created daily, ALDOCX integrates our active-learning (AL) methods, which are designed to efficiently assist anti-virus vendors by better focusing their experts' analytical efforts and enhance detection capability. ALDOCX identifies and acquires new docx files that are most likely malicious, as well as informative benign files. These files are used for enhancing the knowledge stores of both the detection model and the anti-virus software. The evaluation results show that by using ALDOCX and SFEM, we achieved a high detection rate of malicious docx files (94.44% TPR) compared with the anti-virus software (85.9% TPR) - with very low FPR rates (0.19%). ALDOCX's AL methods used only 14% of the labeled docx files, which led to a reduction of 95.5% in security experts' labeling efforts compared with the passive learning and the support vector machine (SVM)-Margin (existing active-learning method). Our AL methods also showed a significant improvement of 91% in number of unknown docx malware acquired, compared with the passive learning and the SVM-Margin, thus providing an improved updating solution for the detection model, as well as the anti-virus software widely used within organizations. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

In order to encourage human-centric architectures in such environments, our smart wristband prototype OperaBLE is introduced in this paper as key enabler for human-in-the-loop systems. Thus, the network deployed in GreenISF is composed of body area networks which monitor labor activity and reinforce security at work by embedding sensors in regulatory industrial clothes. These networks cooperate with our BLE mesh infrastructure aimed to fulfill the major challenges Industry 4.0: zero fails, total coverage, and sustainability. Furthermore, a context information network based on LoRaWAN complements our mesh network to provide the system with valuable environmental data and prevent operators from harmful workplaces. The system is connected to a fog server responsible for preprocessing raw data that will be stored in a global cloud server. The experiments carried out highlight the contribution of OperaBLE towards safer working conditions and a sustainable digitalization of Industry 4.0. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Rapid developments in urbanization and autonomous industrial environments have augmented and expedited the need for intelligent real-time video surveillance. Recent developments in artificial intelligence for anomaly detection in video surveillance only address some of the challenges, largely overlooking the evolving nature of anomalous behaviors over time. Tightly coupled dependence on a known normality training dataset and sparse evaluation based on reconstruction error are further limitations. In this article, we propose the incremental spatiotemporal learner (ISTL) to address challenges and limitations of anomaly detection and localization for real-time video surveillance. ISTL is an unsupervised deep-learning approach that utilizes active learning with fuzzy aggregation, to continuously update and distinguish between new anomalies and normality that evolve over time. ISTL is demonstrated and evaluated on accuracy, robustness, computational overhead as well as contextual indicators, using three benchmark datasets. Results of these experiments validate our contribution and confirm its suitability for real-time video surveillance. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A cyber-physical system (CPS) is an integration of computation with physical processes whose behavior is defined by both computational and physical parts of the system. In this paper, we present a view of the challenges and opportunities for design automation of CPS. We identify a combination of characteristics that define the challenges unique to the design automation of CPS. We then present selected promising advances in depth, focusing on four foundational directions: combining model-based and data-driven design methods; design for human-in-the-loop systems; component-based design with contracts, and design for security and privacy. These directions are illustrated with examples from two application domains: smart energy systems and next-generation automotive systems. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Visual sensor networks (VSNs) are highly vulnerable to attacks due to their open deployment in possibly unattended environments. To improve the network security of VSNs, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is an effective countermeasure. However, as visual sensors can produce big and dynamic video data, it is a tough task to rapidly and effectively detect attacks in VSNs. Moreover, attack samples in VSNs are generally too rare for IDSs to fully understand the behaviors of attacks. Facing these difficulties, in this paper, we propose an efficient intrusion detection approach for VSNs, which is based on traffic pattern learning. In the proposed approach, a traffic model is developed to describe the dynamic characteristics of network traffic in VSNs. Based on this model, the optimal feature set for traffic pattern learning can be extracted. Then a hierarchical self-organizing map (HSOM) is employed to learn traffic patterns and detect intrusions. Furthermore, an active learning strategy is devised to accelerate the training process of the HSOM and better learn the patterns of attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has high detection accuracy and good real-time performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Is Android malware classification a solved problem? Published F1 scores of up to 0.99 appear to leave very little room for improvement. In this paper, we argue that results are commonly inflated due to two pervasive sources of experimental bias: spatial bias caused by distributions of training and testing data that are not representative of a real-world deployment; and temporal bias caused by incorrect time splits of training and testing sets, leading to impossible configurations. We propose a set of space and time constraints for experiment design that eliminates both sources of bias. We introduce a new metric that summarizes the expected robustness of a classifier in a real-world setting, and we present an algorithm to tune its performance. Finally, we demonstrate how this allows us to evaluate mitigation strategies for time decay such as active learning. We have implemented our solutions in TESSERACT, an open source evaluation framework for comparing malware classifiers in a realistic setting. We used TESSERACT to evaluate three Android malware classifiers from the literature on a dataset of 129K applications spanning over three years. Our evaluation confirms that earlier published results are biased, while also revealing counter-intuitive performance and showing that appropriate tuning can lead to significant improvements. © 2019 by The USENIX Association.

abstract={Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied in security-related tasks such as spam and malware detection, although their security properties against deliberate attacks have not yet been widely understood. Intelligent and adaptive attackers may indeed exploit specific vulnerabilities exposed by machine learning techniques to violate system security. Being robust to adversarial data manipulation is thus an important, additional requirement for machine learning algorithms to successfully operate in adversarial settings. In this work, we evaluate the security of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to well-crafted, adversarial label noise attacks. In particular, we consider an attacker that aims to maximize the SVM's classification error by flipping a number of labels in the training data. We formalize a corresponding optimal attack strategy, and solve it by means of heuristic approaches to keep the computational complexity tractable. We report an extensive experimental analysis on the effectiveness of the considered attacks against linear and non-linear SVMs, both on synthetic and real-world datasets. We finally argue that our approach can also provide useful insights for developing more secure SVM learning algorithms, and also novel techniques in a number of related research areas, such as semi-supervised and active learning. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Reliable and timely information on agricultural production is essential for ensuring world food security. Freely available medium-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km2 with a standard error of 23,000 km2. This result is 1.0% lower than USDA's 2015 June survey estimate and 1.9% higher than USDA's 2016 January estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2 months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84%. The field-based sample estimated area was then used to calibrate the map such that the soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the sample-based area estimate. The strength of the sample-based area estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The success of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially other crops in an operational mode. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Internet-enabled cameras pervade daily life, generating a huge amount of data, but most of the video they generate is transmitted over wires and analyzed offline with a human in the loop. The ubiquity of cameras limits the amount of video that can be sent to the cloud, especially on wireless networks where capacity is at a premium. In this paper, we present Vigil, a real-time distributed wireless surveillance system that leverages edge computing to support real-time tracking and surveillance in enterprise campuses, retail stores, and across smart cities. Vigil intelligently partitions video processing between edge computing nodes co-located with cameras and the cloud to save wireless capacity, which can then be dedicated to Wi-Fi hotspots, offsetting their cost. Novel video frame prioritization and traffic scheduling algorithms further optimize Vigil's bandwidth utilization. We have deployed Vigil across three sites in both whitespace and Wi-Fi networks. Depending on the level of activity in the scene, experimental results show that Vigil allows a video surveillance system to support a geographical area of coverage between five and 200 times greater than an approach that simply streams video over the wireless network. For a fixed region of coverage and bandwidth, Vigil outperforms the default equal throughput allocation strategy of Wi-Fi by delivering up to 25% more objects relevant to a user's query. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Big Data Analytics and Deep Learning are two high-focus of data science. Big Data has become important as many organizations both public and private have been collecting massive amounts of domain-specific information, which can contain useful information about problems such as national intelligence, cyber security, fraud detection, marketing, and medical informatics. Companies such as Google and Microsoft are analyzing large volumes of data for business analysis and decisions, impacting existing and future technology. Deep Learning algorithms extract high-level, complex abstractions as data representations through a hierarchical learning process. Complex abstractions are learnt at a given level based on relatively simpler abstractions formulated in the preceding level in the hierarchy. A key benefit of Deep Learning is the analysis and learning of massive amounts of unsupervised data, making it a valuable tool for Big Data Analytics where raw data is largely unlabeled and un-categorized. In the present study, we explore how Deep Learning can be utilized for addressing some important problems in Big Data Analytics, including extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data, semantic indexing, data tagging, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks. We also investigate some aspects of Deep Learning research that need further exploration to incorporate specific challenges introduced by Big Data Analytics, including streaming data, high-dimensional data, scalability of models, and distributed computing. We conclude by presenting insights into relevant future works by posing some questions, including defining data sampling criteria, domain adaptation modeling, defining criteria for obtaining useful data abstractions, improving semantic indexing, semi-supervised learning, and active learning. © 2015, Najafabadi et al.; licensee Springer.},
